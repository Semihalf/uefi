    description: |
      (1) L2DFDBE and L2DFSBE allows software to generate L2DSBE, L2DDBE, VBFSBE, and VBFDBE errors
      for the purposes of testing error handling code.  When one (or both) of these bits are set a
      PL2
      which misses in the L2 will fill with the appropriate error in the first 2 OWs of the fill.
      Software can determine which OW pair gets the error by choosing the desired fill order
      (address<6:5>).  A PL2 which hits in the L2 will not inject any errors.  Therefore sending a
      WBIL2 prior to the PL2 is recommended to make a miss likely (if multiple processors are
      involved software must be careful to be sure no other processor or IO device can bring the
      block
      into the L2).

      To generate a VBFSBE or VBFDBE, software must first get the cache block into the cache with an
      error using a PL2 which misses the L2.  Then a store partial to a portion of the cache block
      without the error must change the block to dirty.  Then, a subsequent WBL2/WBIL2/victim will
      trigger the VBFSBE/VBFDBE error.

    title: L2C XMC command register
    address: 0x1180080800028
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      (1) the XMC command chosen MUST NOT be a IOB destined command or operation is UNDEFINED.

      (2) the XMC command will have sid forced to IOB, did forced to L2C, and xmdmsk forced to
      0. Note that this implies that commands which REQUIRE an XMD cycle (STP,STC,SAA,FAA,FAS)
      should not be used or the results are unpredictable. The sid=IOB means that the way
      partitioning used for the command is L2C_WPAR_IOB. None of L2C_QOS_IOB, L2C_QOS_PP are used
      for these commands.

      (3) any FILL responses generated by the XMC command will be ignored.  Generated INVLs,
      however, will correctly invalidate the required PPs.

      (4) any L2D read generated by the XMC command will record the syndrome information in
      L2C_TAD_ECC0/1.  If ECC is disabled prior to the CSR write this provides the ability to read
      the ECC bits directly.  If ECC is not disabled this should log 0's (assuming no ECC errors
      were found in the block).

      (5) A write which arrives while the INUSE bit is set will block until the INUSE bit clears.
      This gives software 2 options when needing to issue a stream of writes to L2C_XMC_CMD: polling
      on the INUSE bit, or allowing HW to handle the interlock -at the expense of locking up the RSL
      bus for potentially tens of cycles at a time while waiting for an available LFB/VAB entry.
      Note that when the INUSE bit clears the only ordering it implies is that software can send
      another XMC command.  Subsequent commands may complete out of order relative to earlier
      commands.

      (6) The address written to L2C_XMC_CMD is a 40-bit OCTEON physical address.  The L2C performs
      hole removal and, if applicable to the command, index aliasing (if enabled) on the written
      address and uses that for the command. This potentially hole removed/index aliased 40-bit
      address is what is returned on a read of the L2C_XMC_CMD register.

      (7) The order of two CSR generated XMC commands is not guaranteed for different QOS levels

          No way was available for allocation. L2C sets NOWAY during its processing of a transaction
          whenever it needed/wanted to allocate a WAY in the L2 cache, but was unable to. NOWAY==1
          is (generally) not an indication that L2C failed to complete transactions. Rather, it is a
          hint of possible performance degradation. (For example, L2C must read-modify-write DRAM
          for every transaction that updates some, but not all, of the bytes in a cache block,
          misses in the L2 cache, and cannot allocate a WAY.) There is one "failure" case where L2C
          will set NOWAY: when it cannot leave a block locked in the L2 cache as part of a LCKL2
          transaction. See L2C_TTG_ERR for logged information.

      Error info for all TAG SBE/DBE/NOWAY errors.

      (1) The priority of errors (lowest to highest) is NOWAY, SBE, DBE. An error will lock the SYN,
      WAY, and L2IDX fields for equal or lower priority errors until cleared by software.

      (2) The syndrome is recorded for DBE errors, though the utility of the value is not clear.

      (3) A NOWAY error does not change the value of the SYN field, and leaves WAY unpredictable.
      L2IDX[16:7] is the L2 block index associated with the command which had no way to allocate.

      (1) A error will lock the VBF4, INDEX, and SYN0/1 fields and set the bit corresponding to the
      error received. VBFDBE errors take priority and will overwrite an earlier logged VBFSBE
      error. The information from exactly one VBF read will be present at any given time and serves
      to document which error(s) were present in the read with the highest priority error.
