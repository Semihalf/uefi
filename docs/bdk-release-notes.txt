Bringup and Diagnostic Kit (BDK) Release Notes
==============================================

Overview
--------
This document gives a short overview of the major changes
incorporated into each BDK release.

octeon3-bdk-2014.05-FIXME (r95818)
-------------------------
* CN78XX:
    * Initial support for CN78XX and CN77XX
    * Preliminary multi-node support (NUMA)
    * Suppress ethernet name node numbers when there is only one node
    * Update QLM PRBS code to support more than 10 QLMs
    * Require FPA buffers to be a power of 2 so memalign() works. Newlib
        memalign() isn't smart enough to handle alignment that isn't a power
        of 2.
* CN70XX:
    * Support for CN71XX and CN70XX is very minimal, possibly not useful. The
        BDK requires DRAM to be setup to function, so it uses a hardcoded DRAM
        config from the EVB7000. This is unlikely to work on any other board.
    * Enable CN70XX error checking
    * Update CSR functions to properly byte swap SATA and USB assuming the
        blocks are setup for Linux
    * New BDK image bdk-chip-screen.bin supplied as an example
    * Fix setting of RST_PP_POWER when booting cores.
    * Change bdk-quick-boot into bdk-boot-nor-stage1-cn70xx, specialized for
        use on CN70XX
    * Create new doc page about CN70XX and CN71XX
* Import the functionality of hw-ddr2 into the BDK DRAM test code
* Menu to access the PCIe EEPROM
* Move MDIO bus initialization to run early so we can configure PHYs before
    networking is up
* Add Kendin PHY support
* Add Vitesse PHY support
* Add 10G Marvell PHY support
* Fix a non-obvious bug with L2 setup in the BDK. When we initially
    lock L2 before DRAM, the lines involved are not considered dirty
    by L2. Later when we unlock this region (DRAM initialized) these
    lines are discarded instead of writing to DDR. The lines that aren't
    written then get ECC errors on load since DDR was never initialized.
    Simply fix is to always write to all cache lines.
* Change BDK L2 flush to not invalidate
* Rename the flash menu to show it contains eMMC as well
* Don't put luadoc files in release. People should use the html docs
* Rename bdk-full to bdk-full-no-romfs to eliminate confusion
* Improve uart flow control messages
* Cleanup the main menu, putting SERDES options on top
* Create new program for downloading and flashing over xmodem
* Much more robust XMODEM support
* Don't disable indexed aliasing during BDK boot. It's not required on
    CN70XX and hopefully not needed on CN78XX.
* Disable the boot rom when remote booting. It interferes with the bootbus
    moveable regions.
* Only clear large multiply registers if CvmCtl[nomul] is 0. This fixes boot
    on parts without large multiply.
* Remove the HIGIG option from the config menu. The BDK is meant for initial
    board bringup and not software testing. Any board will be brought up in
    without HIGIG as its software configuration is complex. HIGIG will then
    be enabled once are the electricals are stable, when you're done with
    the BDK.


octeon3-bdk-2013.09-88113
-------------------------
* New "OCTEON3-BDK", support for Octeon III chips. This BDK release
        doesn't support Octeon II as those chips are supported by the
        "OCTEON-BDK" releases.
* Fusion, CNF7XXX, is not supported by this release. Use the Octeon II BDK.
* TCP/IP stack removed to save space and bypass issues cause by the LwIP
        stack.
* The bdk-minimal.bin image has been removed. This image was too large
        for use with CN70XX chips.
* For CN70XX, DRAM must already be configured for the BDK to run. The image
        is too large to run from L2.
* CSR accesses that take two parameters now specify the block before the
        index into the block. All two parameter CSR accesses are swapped
        compared to previous BDKs.
* CIU registers are referred to by "CIU_*" regardless of chip. This is
        different than the hardware manual what might use "CIU_*", "CIU2_*",
        or "CIU3_*".
* Network ports are now named using a new syntax
        "<node>.<type><interface>.<port>". The <node> is not used if the
        system is only using a single Octeon chip. Some examples are
        ILK0.0, ILK0.1, ILK1.7, HIGIG0.0 - HIGIG0.15, SGMII0.0.
* QLM auto tuning has been removed. Manual tuning has proven more reliable.
* Lua RPC connection handling is more robust with better timeout handling.
* The Macraigor WifiDemon is now officially supported.
* Code uses hardware floating point.
* Support for PowerPC hosts has been dropped.
* Remote booting using Lauterbach EJTAG is known to not work.
