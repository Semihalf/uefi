      These registers select which group or groups a core belongs to. There are 2 sets of masks per

          Core group mask. A one in any bit position sets the core's membership in the corresponding
          group:
          GRPMSK(0) for groups <63:0>
          GRPMSK(1) for groups <127:64>
          GRPMSK(2) for groups <191:128>
          GRPMSK(3) for groups <255:192>
          A value of 0x0 in each GRPMSK(0..3) for a given core prevents the core from receiving new
          work. Cores that will never receive work should use GRPMSK(0..3)=0x0; while this setting
          is not special in SSO, for backward and forward compatibility this may enable reallocation
          of internal resources to the remaining (non-zero-mask) cores.
