EEPROM read/write commands
--------------------------
'eeprom' command provides support for basic EEPROM operations.

Syntax
------
eeprom [read] [write] [list] [-m] [-c <Chip>] [-a <Address>] [-l <Length>]
[-d <Data>] [-s <Source>]

Usage
-----
One of the read/write/list modes must be specified. 'list' requires no other
specifiers, while read/write always require Address, Length and Chip.
read    - read from EEPROM
write   - write Data to EEPROM, requires -d
list    - list available EEPROM devices
help	- show help
-m      - transfer from/to RAM memory, requires -s
Chip    - EEPROM unique identifier
Address - address in EEPROM to read/write
Data    - data to be written
Length  - length of data to read/write/copy
Source  - address of data in RAM to be copied

Examples
--------
List devices:
  eeprom list
Read 16 bytes from address 0x0 in chip 0x57:
  eeprom read -c 0x57 -a 0x0 -l 0x10
Fill 16 bytes with 0xab at address 0x0 in chip 0x57:
  eeprom write -c 0x57 -a 0x0 -l 0x10 -d 0xab
Copy 8 bytes from 0x2000000 in RAM to EEPROM:
  eeprom write -m -c 0x57 -a 0x0 -l 0x10 -s 0x2000000
Copy 8 bytes from EEPROM to RAM:
  eeprom read -m -c 0x57 -a 0x0 -l 0x10 -s 0x2000000
