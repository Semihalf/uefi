Syntax
------
sf [probe | read | readfile | write | writefile | erase |
    update | updatefile] [<Address> | <FilePath>] <Offset> <Length>

Usage
-----
  sf probe
check response from SPI flash by reading its ID

  sf read <Address> <Offset> <Length>
read from SPI flash Offset into RAM at Address

  sf readfile <FilePath> <Offset> <Length>
read from SPI flash Offset into file placed at FilePath
If file doesn't exists, command creates one

  sf write <Address> <Offset> <Length>
write data from RAM Address into SPI flash at Offset

  sf writefile <FilePath> <Offset>
write data from file placed at FilePath into SPI flash at Offset

  sf erase <Offset> <Length>
erase data in SPI flash at Offset (must be 0x10000 aligned)

  sf update <Address> <Offset> <Length>
update data from RAM Address into SPI flash at Offset,
it firstly erases target sector, then writes data

  sf updatefile <FilePath> <Offset>
update data from file placed at FilePath into SPI flash at Offset
it firstly erases target sector, then writes data

Address  - address in RAM of data to be copied/stored (in hex)
Offset   - offset in SPI flash to read/write (in hex)
Length   - number of bytes to read/write/erase (in hex or dec)
FilePath - path to file to read data into or write/update data from

Examples
--------
Check if there is response from SPI flash
  sf probe
Read 32 bytes from 0xe00000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x100000
  sf read 0x100000 0xe00000 32
Read 0x20 bytes from 0x200000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x300000
  sf read 0x300000 0x200000 0x20
Erase 0x10000 bytes from offset 0x100000 of SPI flash
  sf erase 0x100000 0x100000
Write 16 bytes from 0x200000 at RAM into SPI flash at address 0x4000000
  sf write 0x200000 0x4000000 16
Update 100 bytes from 0x100000 at RAM in SPI flash at address 0xe00000
  sf update 0x100000 0xe00000 100
Read 0x3000 bytes from 0x0 of SPI flash into file fs2:file.bin
  sf readfile fs2:file.bin 0x0 0x3000 
Update data in SPI flash at 0x3000000 from file Linux.efi
  sf update Linux.efi 0x3000000

Notes
-----
1. Reading from SPI flash into file which does not exist, creates one.
2. Reading from SPI flash into file which has smaller size than Length
   parameter, enlarges this file.
3. Reading into file overrides its previous content.
