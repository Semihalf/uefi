Bringup and Diagnostic Kit (BDK) Release Notes
==============================================

Overview
--------
This document gives a short overview of the major changes
incorporated into each BDK release.

octeon3-bdk-2013.09-88113
-------------------------
* New "OCTEON3-BDK", support for Octeon III chips. This BDK release
        doesn't support Octeon II as those chips are supported by the
        "OCTEON-BDK" releases.
* Fusion, CNF7XXX, is not supported by this release. Use the Octeon II BDK.
* TCP/IP stack removed to save space and bypass issues cause by the LwIP
        stack.
* The bdk-minimal.bin image has been removed. This image was too large
        for use with CN70XX chips.
* For CN70XX, DRAM must already be configured for the BDK to run. The image
        is too large to run from L2.
* CSR accesses that take two parameters now specify the block before the
        index into the block. All two parameter CSR accesses are swapped
        compared to previous BDKs.
* CIU registers are referred to by "CIU_*" regardless of chip. This is
        different than the hardware manual what might use "CIU_*", "CIU2_*",
        or "CIU3_*".
* Network ports are now named using a new syntax
        "<node>.<type><interface>.<port>". The <node> is not used if the
        system is only using a single Octeon chip. Some examples are
        ILK0.0, ILK0.1, ILK1.7, HIGIG0.0 - HIGIG0.15, SGMII0.0.
* QLM auto tuning has been removed. Manual tuning has proven more reliable.
* Lua RPC connection handling is more robust with better timeout handling.
* The Macraigor WifiDemon is now officially supported.
* Code uses hardware floating point.
* Support for PowerPC hosts has been dropped.
* Remote booting using Lauterbach EJTAG is known to not work.
