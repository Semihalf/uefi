          This register is not used for PCIE configurations. For non-OCI links, this register
          defaults to R_625G_REFCLK15625_RXAUI. For OCI links, the value is mapped at reset from the
          GSER_SPD and the appropriate table updates are performed so the rate is obtained for the
          particular reference clock.
          It is recommended that the PHY be in reset when reconfiguring the LMODE
          (GSER(0..13)_PHY_CTL[PHY_RESET] is set). If the LMODE is modified when the PHY is out of
          reset, GSER(0..13)_RXTX_STAT[LMC] can be used to determine when the PHY has
          transitioned to the new setting.
          Once the LMODE has been configured, and the PHY is out of reset, the table entries for the
          selected LMODE must be updated to reflect the reference clock speed. Refer to the register
          description and index into the table using the rate and reference speed to obtain the

          The GSER uses electrical idle inference to determine when a RX lane has reentered
          electrical idle (EI). The PHY electrical idle exit detection supports a minimum pulse
          width of 400ps, therefore configurations that run faster than 2.5G can indicate EI when
          the serial lines are still driven. For rates faster than 2.5G, it takes 16K * 8 UI of
          consecutive deasserted GSER(0..13)_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIESTS] for the GSER to infer EI. In the
          event of electrical idle inference, the following happens:
          * GSER(0..13)_RX_EIE_DETSTS[CDRLOCK]<lane> is zeroed
          * GSER(0..13)_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIELTCH]<lane> is zeroed
          * GSER(0..13)_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIESTS]<lane> is zeroed
          * GSER(0..13)_RX_COAST[COAST]<lane> is asserted to prevent the CDR from trying to lock on
          the incoming data stream.
          * GSER(0..13)_RX_EIE_DETEN[EIEDE]<lane> deasserts for a short period of time, and then is
          asserted to begin looking for the Electrical idle Exit condition.
          Writing this register to a non-zero value causes the electrical idle inference to use the
          EII_FILT count instead of the default settings. Each EII_FILT count represents 20 ns of
          incremental EI inference time.
          It is not expected that software will need to use the Electrical Idle Inference logic.

      These are the RAW PCS per lane settings mode 1 registers. There is one register per lane
      (0..3) per GSER per GSER_LMODE_E (0..11). Only one entry is used at any given time in a given
      GSER lane - the one selected by the corresponding GSER(0..13)_LANE_MODE[LMODE].
      These registers are only reset by hardware during chip cold reset.
      The values of the CSR fields in these registers do not change during chip warm or soft resets.
