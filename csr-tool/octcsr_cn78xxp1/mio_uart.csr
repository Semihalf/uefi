          Transmitter holding register empty bit. When programmable THRE interrupt mode is disabled,

          read from MIO_UART0/1_RBR. When this happens, the data in MIO_UART0/1_RBR is overwritten.
          In FIFO mode, an overrun error occurs when the FIFO is full and a new character arrives at
