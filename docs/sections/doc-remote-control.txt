= Using the BDK host Scripts to Control the Target

Lua scripts run on the host PC can remotely control the target through
a serial connection. The serial connection can be either through the
host's serial port (example /dev/ttyUSB0) or using a TCP/IP socket
connection to a terminal server. The connection is controlled by a
environment variable on the host, *OCTEON_REMOTE_CONSOLE*.

. For use through a serial port on the PC

[source, sh]
----
# export OCTEON_REMOTE_CONSOLE=<device_file>
$ export OCTEON_REMOTE_CONSOLE=/dev/ttyUSB0
----

. For use through a TCP/IP connection to a terminal server
+
[source, sh]
----
# export OCTEON_REMOTE_CONSOLE=<ip_address>:<port>
$ export OCTEON_REMOTE_CONSOLE=192.168.1.1:22
----

. It is also possible to use the remote protocol defined by
*OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL*. This should only be used if serial
is not available. It works well over PCIe, but EJTAG is generally
not worth using.
