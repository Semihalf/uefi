          This register can be used for either of the following purposes:
          o To send a specific PCI Express Message, the application
          writes the payload of the Message into this register, then
          sets bit 0 of the Port Link Control Register to send the
          Message.
          o To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all
          TLPs, the application places a 32-bit corruption pattern into
          this register and enables this function by setting bit 25 of
          the Port Link Control Register. When enabled, the transmit
          LCRC result is XOR'd with this pattern before inserting
          it into the packet.

          o 0: BAR 1 is disabled

          Bit 0 is interpreted as BAR Enable when writing to the BAR Mask
          register rather than as a mask bit because bit 0 of a BAR is
          always masked from writing by host software. Bit 0 must be
          written prior to writing the other mask bits.
