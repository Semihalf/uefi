      Flip ECC bits to generate single-bit or double-bit ECC errors in all instances of a given
      memory type. Encodings are as follows.
      0x0 = No error.
      0x1 = Single-bit error on ECC[0].
      0x2 = Single-bit error on ECC[1].
      0x3 = Double-bit error on ECC[1:0].
      L2DFLIP allows software to generate L2DSBE, L2DDBE, VBFSBE, and VBFDBE errors for the purposes
      of testing error handling code. When one (or both) of these bits are set, a PL2 that misses in
      the L2 will fill with the appropriate error in the first two OWs of the fill. Software can
      determine which OW pair gets the error by choosing the desired fill order (address<6:5>). A
      PL2 that hits in the L2 will not inject any errors. Therefore sending a WBIL2 prior to the PL2
      is recommended to make a miss likely. (If multiple processors are involved, software must be
      sure that no other processor or I/O device can bring the block into the L2).
      To generate a VBFSBE or VBFDBE, software must first get the cache block into the cache with an
      error using a PL2 that misses the L2. Then a store partial to a portion of the cache block
      without the error must change the block to dirty. Then, a subsequent WBL2/WBIL2/victim will
      trigger the VBFSBE/VBFDBE error.

          OCI memory writes are blocked and OCI memory reads return unpredictable data. When clear,
          OCI I/O requests and MOC references are processed and sent to OCX where they are
          ultimately discarded. RDDISOCI/WRDISOCI/IORDDISOCI/IOWRDISOCI interrupts occur if and only
          if the corresponding ENAOCI[node] bit is clear. References to the local node (configured
          via OCX_COM_NODE[ID]) ignore the value of ENAOCI[node] because no OCI processing is
          required. Similarly, all I/O references ignore the value of ENAOCI when
          L2C_OCI_CTL[IOFRCL] is set.


  - name: L2C_XMC_CMD
    title: Level 2 Cache ADD Bus Command Register
    address: 0x1180080800028
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      Note the following:
      The ADD bus command chosen must not be a IOB-destined command or operation is UNDEFINED.
      The ADD bus command will have SID forced to IOB, DID forced to L2C, no virtualization checks
      performed (always pass), and xmdmsk forced to 0. Note that this implies that commands that
      REQUIRE a STORE cycle (STP, STC, SAA, FAA, FAS) should not be used or the results are
      unpredictable. The sid = IOB means that the way partitioning used for the command is
      L2C_WPAR_IOB(0..1). Neither L2C_QOS_IOB(0..1) or L2C_QOS_PP(0..47) are used for these
      commands.
      Any FILL responses generated by the ADD bus command are ignored. Generated STINs, however,
      will correctly invalidate the required cores.
      Any L2D read generated by the ADD bus command records the syndrome information in
      L2C_TAD(0..3)_ECC0/1. If ECC is disabled prior to the CSR write, this provides the ability to
      read the ECC bits directly. If ECC is not disabled, this should log zeros (assuming no ECC
      errors were found in the block).
      A write that arrives while the INUSE bit is set will block until the INUSE bit clears. This
      gives software two options when needing to issue a stream of write operations to L2C_XMC_CMD:
      polling on the INUSE bit, or allowing hardware to handle the interlock -- at the expense of
      locking up the RSL bus for potentially tens of cycles at a time while waiting for an available
      LFB/VAB entry. Note that when the INUSE bit clears, the only ordering it implies is that
      software can send another ADD bus command. Subsequent commands may complete out of order
      relative to earlier commands.
      The address written to L2C_XMC_CMD is a physical address. L2C performs hole removal and index
      aliasing (if enabled) on the written address and uses that for the command. This hole
      removed/index aliased address is what is returned on a read of the L2C_XMC_CMD register.

      (3) if the PPID is outside the range of 0-47,255 or if the PP in question is in reset
      a write will be ignored and reads will timeout the RSL bus.

          No way was available for allocation. L2C sets NOWAY during its processing of a transaction
          whenever it needed/wanted to allocate a WAY in the L2 cache, but was unable to. When this
          bit = 1, it is (generally) not an indication that L2C failed to complete transactions.
          Rather, it is a hint of possible performance degradation. (For example, L2C must read-
          modify-write DRAM for every transaction that updates some, but not all, of the bytes in a
          cache block, misses in the L2 cache, and cannot allocate a WAY.) There is one 'failure'
          case where L2C sets NOWAY: when it cannot leave a block locked in the L2 cache as part of
          a LCKL2 transaction. See L2C_TTG(0..7)_ERR for logged information.

      This register records error information for all CBC MIB errors. An error locks the INDEX, and
      SYN fields and set the bit corresponding to the error received. MIBDBE errors take priority
      and overwrite an earlier logged MIBSBE error. Only one of MIBSBE/MIBDBE is set at any given
      time and serves to document which error the INDEX/SYN is associated with. The syndrome is
      recorded for DBE errors, though the utility of the value is not clear.
