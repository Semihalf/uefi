Bringup and Diagnostic Kit (BDK) Release Notes
==============================================

Overview
--------
This document gives a short overview of the major changes
incorporated into each BDK release.

octeon-bdk-2011.06-latest
-------------------------


octeon-bdk-2011.06-61431
------------------------

* Decode register from high bit to low bit, not low to high. This
	matches the documentation better.
* Update DDR menu to allow setting any environment variables.
* Implement SRIOMAINT read and write for the remote utilities.
* Improve SRIO messaging performance.
* Reduce buffer size to save memory and have more packet buffers.
	With a size of (256+128), PKO will be limited to 23688 bytes
	(63 * (256+128-8)). Buffers are now roughly 1/4 the size they
	were before. Double the number of buffers.
* Redo packet receive handling to use a dispatcher that runs on all cores.
* Display the number of free packets in traffic-gen.
* Implement SRIO memory read/write.
* Add methods for bit insert and extract in bit64.
* Buffer characters read while we poll for Control-C. This should stop
	us from dropping characters while traffic-gen updates the screen.
* Update traffic-gen to support packets all the way down to one byte
	for interfaces that can support it (SRIO, LOOP).
* Update SGMII code to report speed based on QLM clock instead of hard
	coded 1Gbps
* Update CN63XX to calculate the XAUI speed based on the QLM
	rate instead of hard coding 10Gbps.
* Preliminary and untested support for CN66XX.


octeon-bdk-2011.05-r60866
-------------------------

* Improvements to RPC marshalling to handle arbitrary strings.
* Check for link training while waiting for PCIe link. This fixes an issue
	where gen2 speeds were sometimes reported when the link was actually
	gen1.
* Allow choosing menu items based on their internal key. Unlike the
	numbers, these don't change when items are added to the menu. The
	special word "keys" turns on/off the display of the keys. This
	should make it easier to script the menus.
* Initial support for QLM diagnostics such as PRBS.
* Add binary flag to all TFTP client documentation examples. Some clients
	defaults to doing line conversions, causing corruption.
* Support for CN63XX pass 2.2.
* Improvements in the telnet server and TCP/IP connections.
* Add support for passing booleans into C functions.

octeon-bdk-2011.05-r60390
-------------------------

* Change logs are not published for this version and previous versions.
