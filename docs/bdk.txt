Scripting
---------

. link:lua/readme.html[Documentation for Lua]
+
Official Lua 5.2 introduction. Start here to learn about the Lua language
used by BDK scripts.

. link:lua/contents.html[Lua Language Reference]
+
Quick reference to the Lua language.

. link:lua-modules/index.html[Lua Module Reference]
+
This is a programmers reference to the Cavium specific Lua modules supplied
by the BDK.

Internals
---------

. link:bdk-internals.html[Internals Overview]
+
This document goes through the internal details of the BDK. Its purpose
is to help people writing applications understand how the BDK works. Users
of the BDK's binary applications do not need these details.

. link:api-docs/html/index.html[Internal C API]
+
Many Lua scripts reference C functions present internally in the BDK. Although
direct access to these functions is unsupported it can be useful to know
some of the internals while debugging.
