= Interactive Lua on the OCTEON Target

The target side binary *bdk-full.bin* supplies a text menu based
interface to board diagnostic functions.  Each menu expects a numeric
input selecting a valid choice from the list of options.  Generally
the last menu choice returns to the previous menu.  The entire
interactive menu interface is written in Lua for easy expansibility.
The source for the menus can be found in the *rom* directory.

TIP: Any prompt supporting line editing in *bdk-full.bin* also
supports RPC calls.  Whenever *bdk-full.bin* is waiting for user
input, you can send a RPC request and get a response.
