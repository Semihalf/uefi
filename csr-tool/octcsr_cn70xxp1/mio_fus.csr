    description: |
      This register exists to support Authentik. Authentik code should read
      this register, then clear VAL to prevent other software from observing the
      value of the TGG fuses.
      INTERNAL: It is never possible to read the TGG fuses via MIO_FUS_RCMD.
      Whenever the fuse corresponding to VAL (TGG<63>) is blown, it is not possible to
      blow any of TGG<62:0>. The fuse corresponding to VAL must be the one and only
      lock down bit for TGG<62:0> - no other fuse lockdown bit can prevent blowing
      TGG<62:0>. It must always be possible to blow the fuse corresponding to
      VAL when it is not already blown. If an Authentik part may be converted
      to a non-Authentik part (via some JTAG mechanism or any other mechanism),
      it must not be possible to read the TGG fuse values from the Authentik
      part by performing this conversion -> the reset value of VAL should be zero in this
      converted case.

        description: |
          Software may write VAL to zero, but cannot write VAL to a one. When VAL is
          a 1, DAT reads the corresponding TGG fuses. When VAL is a zero, DAT reads as
          zeroes. The reset value of this VAL bit is normally its fuse setting (i.e. TGG<63>).

      MIO_FUS_RCMD[DAT] is valid. In addition, if the efuse read went to the efuse banks (e.g.

          To write a bank of fuses, software must set MIO_FUS_WADR[ADDR] to the bank to be
          programmed and then set each bit within MIO_FUS_BNK_DATX to indicate which fuses to blow.
          Once ADDR, and DAT are setup, SW can write to MIO_FUS_PROG[PROG] to start the bank write
          and poll on PROG. Once PROG is clear, the bank write is complete. A soft blow is still
          subject to lockdown fuses. After a soft/warm reset, the chip will behave as though the
          fuses were actually blown. A cold reset restores the actual fuse values.

    description: |
      IFB fuses are 0 to 1791. The reset values are for IFB fuses for PLL_REF_CLK up to 100MHz when
      core PLL is engaged. If any of the formulas below result in a value less than zero, the
      corresponding timing parameter should be set to zero.
      Prior to issuing a read to the fuse banks (via MIO_FUS_RCMD), this register should be written
      with the timing parameters that will be read.
      This register should not be written while MIO_FUS_RCMD[PEND] = 1.
