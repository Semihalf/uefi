= Overview

The "Bringup and Diagnostic Kit" (BDK) is a set of executables and
scripts designed to ease the bringup of new hardware based on Cavium
Networks line of OCTEON processors.  To ease development and increase
maintainability, diagnostics are written in a high level scripting
language, Lua.  Lua was chosen due to its simple syntax, ease of
integration with C, and small resource requirements.  The BDK is
capable of running a full interactive Lua environment from L2 cache
before DRAM is configured.

.Features of the BDK
* Simple menu driven interface for testing many I/Os.
* Built in traffic generation for ethernet based I/Os.
* Many I/Os can be tested before DRAM is configured.
* Prebuilt known good binaries for booting new hardware.
* Easy automation of tasks through scripts running on a PC.
* Fast PC based test development using a remote board.
* GUI based interactive script debugger.
* Lua remote procedure calls over serial, tcp/ip, PCIe, or EJTAG.
* Remote booting over PCIe and EJTAG.
