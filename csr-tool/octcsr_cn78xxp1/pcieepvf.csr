          o To send a specific PCI Express Message, the application
          writes the payload of the Message into this register, then
          sets bit 0 of the Port Link Control Register to send the
          Message.
          o To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all
          TLPs, the application places a 32-bit corruption pattern into
          this register and enables this function by setting bit 25 of
          the Port Link Control Register. When enabled, the transmit
          LCRC result is XOR'd with this pattern before inserting
          it into the packet.

          o 111111: x32 (not supported)
          This field indicates the MAXIMUM number of lanes supported
          by the PCIe port. The value can be set less than 0x7
          to limit the number of lanes the PCIe will attempt to use.
          If the value of 0xF set by the HW is not desired,
          this field can be programmed to a smaller value (i.e. EEPROM)
          See also MLW.
          (Note: The value of this field does NOT indicate the number
          of lanes in use by the PCIe. LME sets the max number of lanes
          in the PCIe core that COULD be used. As per the PCIe specs,
          the PCIe core can negotiate a smaller link width, so all
          of x8, x4, x2, and x1 are supported when LME=0xF,
          for example.)
