The files in this directory are binary images for running on OCTEON
targets.  Each image is a composite of other images generated by
bdk-update-all. Use bdk-update-all to update these images if you add
or change and Lua files.

bdk-boot-nor-cn70xx.bin:

Image for booting a CN70XX or CN71XX part using parallel NOR. Burn this
to flash at the beginning of flash.

bdk-chip-screen-cn70xx.bin:

This is an example image based on rom/chip-screen. It is not likely
useful as is, but serves as an example of what can be done using
custom Lua scripts.

bdk-xmodem-load.bin:

This image runs from L2 cache and uploads files through Xmodem. Files
can be written to parallel NOR, MMC, eMMC, SD, and SPI NOR. The most
common way to use this image is by booting over EJTAG. Once booted,
a menu is presented of options. The initial baudrate is 115200, no
parity, 1 stop bit.
