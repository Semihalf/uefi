  This section describes the PCIe configuration registers available in RC mode. Note that the
  PCIERC()_CFG* CSRs (PCICONFIGRC) can only be accessed via the
  PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers; they cannot be accessed via the PCIe port. The ADDR
  field of the PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers must match the address listed in PCIERC
  Registers.

          Other message register. This register can be used for either of the following purposes:
          * To send a specific PCI Express message, the application writes the payload of the
          message into this register, then sets bit 0 of the port link control register to send the
          message.
          * To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all TLPs, the application
          places a 32-bit corruption pattern into this register and enables this function by setting
          bit 25 of the port link control register. When enabled, the transmit LCRC result is XORed
          with this pattern before inserting it into the packet.
