    description: |
      Enumerates the different algorithms for managing auras, see PKO_SEND_AURA_S[ALG]. When a
      PKO_SEND_AURA_S is not present in the PKO send descriptor, these algorithms are not relevant.
      When using an algorithm other than NOP, generally FPA_AURA(0..1023)_CFG[PTR_DIS] is set as
      otherwise FPA will use its default algorithm of aura_cnt = aura_cnt - mbufs_freed. Mbufs_freed
      is the number of FPA frees during all PKO processing of all prior PKO_SEND_GATHER_S and
      PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptors in this PKO send descriptor.

        value: 0x0
        description: |
          Two-rate, three-color coloring. Normal enabled mode. Both the CIR and EIR/PIR counters are
          used and adjusted per mode as the packet traverses through an enabled shaper. The internal
          color of a packet can be any of green, yellow, or red after a shaper, depending on the
          shaper state. This is the default when a PKO_SEND_EXT_S is not present in the descriptor.

      - name: EIR_PIR_ONLY
        value: 0x1
        description: |
          Two-rate, two-color coloring based on EIR/PIR. The packet uses and adjusts only the
          EIR/PIR counter as it traverses through an enabled shaper, and does not use nor adjust the
          CIR counter in the shaper. For an enabled RFC2697 mode shaper with this selection for a
          packet, the used counter is EIR, and the shaper is effectively always yellow or red state,
          so the packet will exit through the shaper internally colored either yellow or red. For an
          enabled RFC2698 mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the used counter is PIR, and
          the shaper is effectively always green or red state, so the packet could exit through the
          shaper with either the same internal color or downgraded to red. (A.K.A. disable CIR)

          One-rate, two-color based on CIR. The packet uses and adjusts only the CIR counter as it

          the shaper.  For an enabled RFC2697 mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the
          shaper is effectively always green or red state, so the packet could exit through the

          mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the shaper is effectively always green or
          yellow state, so the packet could exit through the shaper with either the same internal
          color or downgraded from green to yellow. (A.K.A. disable PIR)

      - name: NO_COLOR

        description: |
          No coloring. No shaper can change the packet from its initial green color. Neither the CIR

  - name: PKO_SEND_CRC_S
    description: |
      The Send CRC subdescriptor specifies a CRC calculation be performed during transmission. See
      Send CRC.
      There may be up to N (two?) PKO_SEND_CRC_S's per packet send descriptor.
      PKO_SEND_CRC_S constraints:
      (1) PKO_SEND_CRC_S subdescriptors must precede all PKO_SEND_LINK_S, PKO_SEND_GATHER_S,
          and PKO_SEND_IMM_S subdescriptors in the packet descriptor.
      (2) No two PKO_SEND_CRC_S subdescriptors can overlap. Two PKO_SEND_CRC_S's would
          overlap if any bytes are covered by both, or if the checksum calculated for
          one should be covered by the other.
      (3) If PKO_SEND_HDR_S[CKL3] is set, the bytes covered or inserted by the CRC must not
          overlap the IPv4 header bytes (including any options). The IPv4 header bytes (and
          options) start at byte PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR] in the packet in this case.
      (4) If PKO_SEND_HDR_S[CKL4] is non-zero, the bytes covered or inserted by each individual
          PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRC must entirely reside within the L4 payload. The L4 (TCP/UDP/SCTP)
          header starts at byte PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L4PTR] in the packet in this case, and the L4
          payload follows the L4 header. In this case, the PKO will appear to calculate the
          L4 checksum last, after it has completed all PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRC's.
      (5) If the packet L2 or L3 header is to be colored, the bytes covered or inserted by
          the PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRC must not overlap any of the relevant L2/L3 header bytes,
          including all options, extension headers, etc. Either PKO_SEND_EXT_S[MARKPTR] or
          PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR] locate the L2/L3 header in this case (PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR]
          only if PKO_SEND_EXT_S[MARKPTR] does not exist in the descriptor). PKO coloring is
          indirectly enabled and further positioned via PKO_SEND_HDR_S[FORMAT] programming.

          more than the default - it completely controls whether a buffer is freed by the PKO
          hardware. If [II] is clear, the I bit in the segment/gather pointer (PKO_SEND_GATHER_S or
          PKO_SEND_LINK_S format) can invert the default behavior (i.e. If [II] is clear, the buffer

      - name: N2
        bits: 42
        description: |
          No L2 Allocate. When clear, PKO allocates all load data into the L2 cache. When set, PKO
          does not allocate blocks containing segment bytes into the L2 cache.
          [N2] affects performance, but otherwise does not affect CN78XX behavior. It may be
          advantageous to set [N2] if packet data will not be used after PKO sends the packet, which
          will allow the L2 cache to retain other more useful information.
          Note PKO always allocates descriptor chunks and gather lists into the L2 cache. Also, PKO
          always allocates packet data into the cache on the first-pass packet read of a two-pass
          TCP/UDP checksum calculation. Refer to Performance for more performance details regarding
          this calculation.

          Little Endian. When clear, PKO operates in the default big-endian mode for the entire

          pointers and segment bytes are interpreted in little-endian order. In little-endian mode,
          the following apply:
          The PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[ADDR] and PKO_SEND_LINK_S[ADDR] fields are a little-endian byte
          pointer rather than a big-endian one.
          Operations are fetched from L2/DRAM in little-endian format rather than big-endian format.
          Unaligned segment pointers (in send linked operations) must be in correct little-endian
          format, eight bytes prior to the segment bytes (i.e. the least-significant eight bytes of
          the pointer are first, the next least-significant bytes are next, etc.).

      - name: DS

          Checksum L3. If set, PKO hardware calculates the IPv4 header checksum and inserts it into
          the packet, as described in L4 Checksum. When set, [L3PTR] selects the location of the
          first byte of the L3 header and no L3 header bytes selected by [L3PTR] can overlap with
          any bytes covered or inserted by PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRCs. When CKL3 is set, [L3PTR]
          must point to a valid IPv4 header.

      - name: CKL4
        bits: 47..46
        description: |
          Checksum L4, enumerated with PKO_CKL4ALG_E. If non-zero (not NONE):
          * PKO hardware calculates the Layer 4 TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum for the
          packet and inserts it into the packet, as described in L4 Checksum.
          * [L4PTR] selects the first byte of the L4 header, and [L3PTR] must indicate the location of the
          immediately proceeding and adjacent L3 header.
          * The L4 length field must  not require more than [TOTAL] bytes in the packet.
          * When PKO_SEND_CRC_S are present, the bytes covered or inserted by PKO_SEND_CRC_S must
          all reside in the L4 payload. Conceptually, PKO processes PKO_SEND_CRC_S before L4

      format in the descriptor, else standard big-endian format. See Send Immediate.
      There may be multiple PKO_SEND_IMM_S's in one PKO Send Descriptor, but at least one

      The first segment is specified directly by the subdescriptor,
      and remaining segments are linked from the preceding segment.
      At most one PKO_SEND_LINK_S can be present in a PKO Send descriptor, and it
      must follow all PKO_SEND_GATHER_S and PKO_SEND_IMM_S subdescriptors in the
      Send descriptor. The total number of bytes contributed from the PKO_SEND_LINK_S
      and its links is PKO_SEND_HDR_S[TOTAL] minus the sum of all preceding
      PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[SIZE]'s and PKO_SEND_IMM_S[SIZE]'s in the descriptor.
      To read these packet bytes, PKO traverses as many links as needed starting
      with the PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptor.
      A PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptor must not be present if the sum of all
      PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[SIZE]'s and PKO_SEND_IMM_S[SIZE]'s in the descriptor
      meets or exceeds PKO_SEND_HDR_S[TOTAL].
      The number of segments in a PKO_SEND_LINK_S chain must never exceed 200.

      The Send Memory subdescriptor will atomically set, increment or decrement a

      PKO_SEND_MEM_S subdescriptors must follow all PKO_SEND_EXT_S, PKO_SEND_LINK_S,
      PKO_SEND_GATHER_S, PKO_SEND_IMM_S, and PKO_SEND_CRC_S subdescriptors
      in the packet descriptor.
      PKO will not initiate the memory update for this subdescriptor
      until after it has completed all L2/DRAM fetches that service all prior
      PKO_SEND_LINK_S and PKO_SEND_GATHER_S subdescriptors.
      Performance is best if a memory decrement by one is used rather than any
      other memory set/increment/decrement. (Less internal bus bandwidth is used
      with memory decrements by one.)

          Pointer Cache Flush Enable:
          When set to 1 this flag commands the DPFI logic

          and return them to the FPA. The flush operation is
          complete when the CACHE_FLUSHED flag in the

          This flush mechanism should only be enabled when the PKO
          is quiescent and is intended as test/debug feature.
