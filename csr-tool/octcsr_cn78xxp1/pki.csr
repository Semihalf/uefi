          terminate control cycle. For BGX interfaces operating at data rates of <= 1 Gb/s, the
          packet had a CarrierExtendError before the slot time expired. For ILK interfaces, an SOP-

          PKI_CL(0..3)_INT[PCAM_CONF] was also set. Once a conflict is detected, the PCAM state is
          unpredictable and is required to be fully reconfigured before further valid processing can

    description: |
      Enumerates the virtual-CAM type for the PKI_CL(0..3)_PCAM(0..1)_TERM(0..191)[TERM] field.
      In the table below:
      * 'MATCH' refers to PKI_CL(0..3)_PCAM(0..1)_MATCH(0..191).
      * 'ACTION' refers to PKI_CL(0..3)_PCAM(0..1)_ACTION(0..191) for the PCAM entry that matches.
      * The 'Bank' column indicates which PCAM bank must contain the match data.
      * The 'Adv' column indicates if ACTION[ADVANCE] may be non-zero.
      * The 'PMC' column indicates if ACTION[PMC] may be non-zero.

      The 'SETTY' column indicates if ACTION[SETTY] may be non-zero, and if so which WQE pointer
      field and type field will get set with the specified value. For example, LFTY indicates if
      ACTION[SETTY] then WQE[LFTY] will be set to ACTION[SETTY] and WQE[LFPTR] will be set to the
      current parse point.
      INTERNAL The CAM is banked for alternating accesses, so PKI_PCAM_TERM_E's LSB must toggle
      between each sequencer access for maximum performance.

    title: PKI Buffer Link Structure
    description: |
      The PKI hardware links the packet segments in PKI Hardware Allocating Multiple Buffers
      together with buffer pointers. It writes the first buffer pointer in the work-queue entry
      created for the packet, and writes all subsequent buffer pointers exactly eight bytes before
      the first byte of packet data. Note that the buffer-pointer field in the last buffer contains
      unpredictable data that should never be used by core software. All other buffer pointers are
      valid ones. The PKI hardware allocates space in every buffer for a buffer pointer prior to the
      packet data in the buffer, though the buffer-pointer field in the last buffer is undefined.
    fields:
      - name: ADDR
        bits: 41..0
        description: |
          Physical Address. ADDR is the physical L2/DRAM address of the first byte of packet data in
          the buffer. The ADDR field in the PKI_BUFLINK_S in the work-queue entry (located at
          WQE[ADDR] minus 8 bytes) might not be aligned on a 64-bit boundary, but the buffer
          pointers in all subsequent buffers are naturally aligned on a 64-bit boundary.

          Size of pointed-to buffer. Except for the last valid-buffer pointer, the SIZE field
          contains exactly the number of bytes of packet data held in the buffer that is pointed to.
          The SIZE field in the last valid-buffer pointer indicates the distance from ADDR to the
          end of the buffer, just like the SIZE field in all other valid-buffer pointers. However,
          the SIZE field in the last valid-buffer pointer is larger than the number of bytes of
          packet data in the last buffer unless the packet ends exactly on the buffer boundary. When
          there is only one buffer, the last valid-buffer pointer is the one in the work-queue
          entry. Otherwise, the last valid-buffer pointer is the one in the second-to-last buffer.

          be made. It is still useful for this bit to exist in case that property every changes and
          the reset requires a longer duration. For this implementation, SW will check the bit which
          will always report not BUSY allowing SW to proceed with its flow.

          For example an Ethertype match action that wishes to resume with additional Ethertype
          matches would use a zero PMC to indicate no parse mode change. An Ethertype match action
