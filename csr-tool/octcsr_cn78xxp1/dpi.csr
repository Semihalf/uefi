          The DMA engines will compete for shared resources.
          If the HW detects that particular engines are not

          DMA Engine Commit Mode
          When COMMIT_MODE=0, DPI considers an instruction
          complete when the HW internally generates the
          final write for the current instruction.
          When COMMIT_MODE=1, DPI additionally waits for
          the final write to reach the interface coherency
          point to declare the instructions complete.
          Please note: when COMMIT_MODE == 0, DPI may not
          follow the HRM ordering rules.
          DPI hardware performance may be better with
          COMMIT_MODE == 0 than with COMMIT_MODE == 1 due
          to the relaxed ordering rules.
          If the HRM ordering rules are required, set
          COMMIT_MODE == 1.

          DPI_SLI_PRTx_ERR and DPI_SLI_PRTx_ERR_INFO have

          When Octeon first detects an ErrorResponse, the
          TYPE, REQQ, and ADDR of the error is saved and an
          internal lock state is set so the data associated
          with the initial error is perserved.
          Subsequent ErrorResponses will optionally raise
          an interrupt, but will not modify the TYPE, REQQ,
          or ADDR fields until the internal lock state is
          cleared.
          SW can clear the internal lock state by writting
          a '1' to the appropriate bit in either
          DPI_REQ_ERR_RSP or DPI_PKT_ERR_RSP depending on
          the TYPE field.
          Once the internal lock state is cleared,
