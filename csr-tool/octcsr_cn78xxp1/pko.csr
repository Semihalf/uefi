    description: |
      Enumerates the different algorithms for managing auras, see PKO_SEND_AURA_S[ALG]. When a
      PKO_SEND_AURA_S is not present in the PKO send descriptor, these algorithms are not relevant.
      When using an algorithm other than NOP, generally FPA_AURA(0..1023)_CFG[PTR_DIS] is set as
      otherwise FPA will use its default algorithm of aura_cnt = aura_cnt - mbufs_freed. Mbufs_freed
      is the number of FPA frees during all PKO processing of all prior PKO_SEND_GATHER_S and
      PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptors in this PKO send descriptor.

        value: 0x0
        description: |
          Two-rate, three-color coloring. Normal enabled mode. Both the CIR and EIR/PIR counters are
          used and adjusted per mode as the packet traverses through an enabled shaper. The internal
          color of a packet can be any of green, yellow, or red after a shaper, depending on the
          shaper state. This is the default when a PKO_SEND_EXT_S is not present in the descriptor.

      - name: EIR_PIR_ONLY
        value: 0x1
        description: |
          Two-rate, two-color coloring based on EIR/PIR. The packet uses and adjusts only the
          EIR/PIR counter as it traverses through an enabled shaper, and does not use nor adjust the
          CIR counter in the shaper. For an enabled RFC2697 mode shaper with this selection for a
          packet, the used counter is EIR, and the shaper is effectively always yellow or red state,
          so the packet will exit through the shaper internally colored either yellow or red. For an
          enabled RFC2698 mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the used counter is PIR, and
          the shaper is effectively always green or red state, so the packet could exit through the
          shaper with either the same internal color or downgraded to red (i.e. CIR is disabled).

      - name: CIR_ONLY
        value: 0x2
        description: |
          One-rate, two-color based on CIR. The packet uses and adjusts only the CIR counter as it
          traverses through an enabled shaper, and does not use nor adjust the EIR/PIR counter in
          the shaper. For an enabled RFC2697 mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the
          shaper is effectively always green or red state, so the packet could exit through the
          shaper with either the same internal color or downgraded to red. For an enabled RFC2698
          mode shaper with this selection for a packet, the shaper is effectively always green or
          yellow state, so the packet could exit through the shaper with either the same internal
          color or downgraded from green to yellow (i.e. PIR is disabled.)

      - name: NO_COLOR
        value: 0x3
        description: |
          No coloring. No shaper can change the packet from its initial green color. Neither the CIR

  - name: PKO_SEND_CRC_S
    description: |
      The Send CRC subdescriptor specifies a CRC calculation be performed during transmission. See
      Send CRC.
      There may be up to N (two?) PKO_SEND_CRC_Ss per packet send descriptor. PKO_SEND_CRC_S
      constraints:
      PKO_SEND_CRC_S subdescriptors must precede all PKO_SEND_LINK_S, PKO_SEND_GATHER_S, and
      PKO_SEND_IMM_S subdescriptors in the packet descriptor.
      No two PKO_SEND_CRC_S subdescriptors can overlap. Two PKO_SEND_CRC_Ss would overlap if any
      bytes are covered by both, or if the checksum calculated for one should be covered by the
      other.
      If PKO_SEND_HDR_S[CKL3] is set, the bytes covered or inserted by the CRC must not overlap the
      IPv4 header bytes (including any options). The IPv4 header bytes (and options) start at byte
      PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR] in the packet in this case.
      If PKO_SEND_HDR_S[CKL4] is nonzero, the bytes covered or inserted by each individual
      PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRC must entirely reside within the L4 payload. The L4 (TCP/UDP/SCTP) header
      starts at byte PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L4PTR] in the packet in this case, and the L4 payload follows
      the L4 header. In this case, the PKO will appear to calculate the L4 checksum last, after it
      has completed all PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRCs.
      If the packet L2 or L3 header is to be colored, the bytes covered or inserted by the
      PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRC must not overlap any of the relevant L2/L3 header bytes, including all
      options, extension headers, etc. Either PKO_SEND_EXT_S[MARKPTR] or PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR]
      locate the L2/L3 header in this case (PKO_SEND_HDR_S[L3PTR] only if PKO_SEND_EXT_S[MARKPTR]
      does not exist in the descriptor). PKO coloring is indirectly enabled and further positioned
      via PKO_SEND_HDR_S[FORMAT] programming.

          exactly [L4PTR] bytes from the beginning of the packet. Software might populate this field
          for forwarded packets from a computation based off WQE[L4PTR], which is the IP location
          computed by PKI when the packet is parsed. When [CKL4] is nonzero, no L4 header bytes

          more than the default -- it completely controls whether a buffer is freed by the PKO

          No L2 Allocate. When clear, PKO allocates all load data into the L2 cache. When set, PKO
          does not allocate blocks containing segment bytes into the L2 cache.
          [N2] affects performance, but otherwise does not affect CN78XX behavior. It may be
          advantageous to set [N2] if packet data will not be used after PKO sends the packet, which
          will allow the L2 cache to retain other more useful information.
          Note that PKO always allocates descriptor chunks and gather lists into the L2 cache. Also,
          PKO always allocates packet data into the cache on the first-pass packet read of a two-
          pass TCP/UDP checksum calculation. Refer to Section TBD for more performance details
          regarding this calculation.

      - name: LE

          Little Endian. When clear, PKO operates in the default big-endian mode for the entire
          packet send descriptor, as the diagrams in this section show. When set, all segment
          pointers and segment bytes are interpreted in little-endian order. In little-endian mode,
          the following apply:
          The PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[ADDR] and PKO_SEND_LINK_S[ADDR] fields are a little-endian byte
          pointer rather than a big-endian one.
          Operations are fetched from L2/DRAM in little-endian format rather than big-endian format.
          Unaligned segment pointers (in send linked operations) must be in correct little-endian
          format, eight bytes prior to the segment bytes (i.e. the least-significant eight bytes of
          the pointer are first, the next least-significant bytes are next, etc.).

      - name: DS

          the packet, as described in L4 Checksum. When set, [L3PTR] selects the location of the
          first byte of the L3 header and no L3 header bytes selected by [L3PTR] can overlap with
          any bytes covered or inserted by PKO_SEND_CRC_S CRCs. When [CKL3] is set, [L3PTR]must
          point to a valid IPv4 header.

        bits: 47..46
        description: |
          Checksum L4, enumerated with PKO_CKL4ALG_E. If nonzero (not NONE):
          PKO hardware calculates the Layer 4 TCP/UDP/SCTP checksum for the packet and inserts it
          into the packet, as described in L4 Checksum.
          [L4PTR] selects the first byte of the L4 header, and [L3PTR] must indicate the location of
          the immediately proceeding and adjacent L3 header.
          The L4 length field must not require more than [TOTAL] bytes in the packet.
          When PKO_SEND_CRC_S are present, the bytes covered or inserted by PKO_SEND_CRC_S must all
          reside in the L4 payload. Conceptually, PKO processes PKO_SEND_CRC_S before L4 checksums
          when both are present.

      a multiple of 8 bytes. If PKO_SEND_HDR_S[LE] is set, the immediate bytes are in little-endian
      format in the descriptor, else standard big-endian format. See Send Immediate.
      There may be multiple PKO_SEND_IMM_Ss in one PKO Send Descriptor, but at least one
      PKO_SEND_GATHER_S must be between any two consecutive PKO_SEND_IMM_Ss. A PKO_SEND_IMM_S must

  - name: PKO_SEND_LINK_S
    description: |
      The Send Linked subdescriptor specifies a linked list of data segments to construct the last
      data for the packet. See Send Linked.
      The first segment is specified directly by the subdescriptor, and remaining segments are
      linked from the preceding segment. At most one PKO_SEND_LINK_S can be present in a PKO Send
      descriptor, and it must follow all PKO_SEND_GATHER_S and PKO_SEND_IMM_S subdescriptors in the
      Send descriptor. The total number of bytes contributed from the PKO_SEND_LINK_S and its links
      is PKO_SEND_HDR_S[TOTAL] minus the sum of all preceding PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[SIZE]s and
      PKO_SEND_IMM_S[SIZE]s in the descriptor.
      To read these packet bytes, PKO traverses as many links as needed starting with the
      PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptor. A PKO_SEND_LINK_S subdescriptor must not be present if the sum
      of all PKO_SEND_GATHER_S[SIZE]s and PKO_SEND_IMM_S[SIZE]s in the descriptor meets or exceeds
      PKO_SEND_HDR_S[TOTAL]. The number of segments in a PKO_SEND_LINK_S chain must never exceed
      200.

          A static priority child queue with priority PRIO must be located at

          There can be at most one static priority child queue at each

          Round-robin priority. The priority assigned to the round-robin scheduler.
          A higher-level queue is a child queue of this shaper when its
          PKO_*_TOPOLOGY[PARENT] selects this shaper, and it further is a
          round robin child queue when its PKO_*_SQn_SCHEDULE[PRIO] equals

          have the same priority. But the number of round-robin child queues
          attached (at this priority) is limited only by the number of
          higher-level queues. When this shaper is not used, we recommend
          RR_PRIO be zero. When a shaper is used, RR_PRIO should be 0xF
          when there are no priorities with more than one child
          queue (i.e. when there are no round-robin child queues), and
          should otherwise be a legal priority (values 0-9).

          PRIO be zero. The legal PRIO values are 0-9 when the SQ is used.
          In addition to priority, PRIO determines whether the SQ is a static
          queue or not: If PRIO equals PKO_*_SQn_TOPOLOGY[RR_PRIO], where
          PKO_*_TOPOLOGY[PARENT] for this SQ equals n, then this
          is a round-robin child queue into the shaper at the next level.

          "The PKO supports up to 29 independent TX FIFOs where 0-27 are physical and 28 is
          virtual. The FIFOs are grouped into 8 sets of four contiguously numbered queues
          where each FIFO has a base storage amount of 2.5K bytes of buffering.

          PKO_PTGF(0)_CFG -> FIFO#  0-3
          PKO_PTGF(1)_CFG -> FIFO#  4-7
          PKO_PTGF(2)_CFG -> FIFO#  8-11
          PKO_PTGF(3)_CFG -> FIFO#  12-15
          PKO_PTGF(4)_CFG -> FIFO#  16-19
          PKO_PTGF(5)_CFG -> FIFO#  20-23
          PKO_PTGF(6)_CFG -> FIFO#  24-27
          PKO_PTGF(7)_CFG -> FIFO#  28   (Virtual/NULL)

          Within each set, 2 or 4 FIFOs can be combined to produce a larger FIFO if desired.
          The SIZE field is used to configure the number and depth of the FIFOs in a set. The
          supported options for a FIFO set are as follows:

          SIZE: Set of 4 Contiguously Numbered FIFOs
          ------------------------------------------
          xxx      Queue0  Queue1  Queue2  Queue3
          000 :     2.5k    2.5k    2.5k    2.5k
          001 :     5.0k    0.0k    2.5k    2.5k
          010 :     2.5k    2.5k    5.0k    0.0k
          011 :     5.0k    0.0k    5.0k    0.0k
          1xx :    10.0k    0.0k    0.0k    0.0k

          Note that when a FIFO is set to a size of 0K bytes that FIFO_NUM is no longer legal and
          cannot be assigned to an active MAC. For example, for the set of FIFOs 8-11, if the
          PKO_PTGF(2)_CFG.SIZE = 3'b100 then FIFO_NUMs 9, 10 and 11 are no longer valid. Only
          FIFO_NUM = 8 is available from this set for assignment to a MAC because all of the
          10 Kbytes of buffering was configured to FIFO#8.

          FIFO_NUM = 28 is a virtual FIFO and is used exclusively to indicate the NULL FIFO. Packets
          targeting the NULL FIFO are dropped by the PKO and their buffers returned to the FPA."
