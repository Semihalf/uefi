registers:
  - name: GMX(0..1)_RX(0..3)_INT_REG
    title: Interrupt Register
    address: 0x1180008000000 + a*0x8000000 + b*0x800
    bus: RSL
    internal: |
      (1) exceptions will only be raised to the control processor if the
      corresponding bit in the GMX_RX_INT_EN register is set.
      (2) exception conditions 10:0 can also set the rcv/opcode in the received
      packet's workQ entry.  The GMX_RX_FRM_CHK register provides a bit mask
      for configuring which conditions set the error.
      (3) in half duplex operation, the expectation is that collisions will appear
      as either MINERR o r CAREXT errors.
      (4) JABBER An RX Jabber error indicates that a packet was received which
      is longer than the maximum allowed packet as defined by the
      system.  GMX will truncate the packet at the JABBER count.
      Failure to do so could lead to system instabilty.
      (5) NIBERR This error is illegal at 1000Mbs speeds
      (GMX_RX_PRT_CFG[SPEED]==0) and will never assert.
      (6) MAXERR for untagged frames, the total frame DA+SA+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS >
      GMX_RX_FRM_MAX.  For tagged frames, DA+SA+VLAN+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS
      > GMX_RX_FRM_MAX + 4*VLAN_VAL + 4*VLAN_STACKED.
      (7) MINERR total frame DA+SA+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS < 64
      (8) ALNERR Indicates that the packet received was not an integer number of
      bytes.  If FCS checking is enabled, ALNERR will only assert if
      the FCS is bad.  If FCS checking is disabled, ALNERR will
      assert in all non-integer frame cases.
      (9) Collisions Collisions can only occur in half-duplex mode.  A collision
      is assumed by the receiver when the slottime
      (GMX_PRT_CFG[SLOTTIME]) is not satisfied.  In 10/100 mode,
      this will result in a frame < SLOTTIME.  In 1000 mode, it
      could result either in frame < SLOTTIME or a carrier extend
      error with the SLOTTIME.  These conditions are visible by...
      . transfer ended before slottime COLDET
      . carrier extend error           CAREXT
      (A) LENERR Length errors occur when the received packet does not match the
      length field.  LENERR is only checked for packets between 64
      and 1500 bytes.  For untagged frames, the length must exact
      match.  For tagged frames the length or length+4 must match.
      (B) PCTERR checks that the frame begins with a valid PREAMBLE sequence.
      Does not check the number of PREAMBLE cycles.
      (C) OVRERR *DON'T PUT IN HRM*
      OVRERR is an architectural assertion check internal to GMX to
      make sure no assumption was violated.  In a correctly operating
      system, this interrupt can never fire.
      GMX has an internal arbiter which selects which of 4 ports to
      buffer in the main RX FIFO.  If we normally buffer 8 bytes,
      then each port will typically push a tick every 8 cycles if
      the packet interface is going as fast as possible.  If there
      are four ports, they push every two cycles.  So that's the
      assumption.  That the inbound module will always be able to
      consume the tick before another is produced.  If that doesn't
      happen that's when OVRERR will assert.
      (D) In XAUI mode prt0 is used for interrupt logging.

      In either mode, the PREAMBLE+SFD bytes are not counted toward the packet

          CAM Entry Enables

          GMX has 32 DMAC entries that can be accessed with
          the GMX_RX[0..3]_ADR_CAM[0..5] CSRs.
          These 32 DMAC entries can be used by any of the
          four SGMII MACs or the XAUI MAC.

          Each port interface has independent control of
          which of the 32 DMAC entries to include in the
          CAM lookup.

          Legacy GMX implementations were able to CAM
          against eight DMAC entries while current
          implementations use 32 common entries.
          This register is intended for legacy applications
          that only require eight DMAC CAM entries per MAC.
          New applications may choose to ignore
          GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_EN using GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN
          instead.

          EN controls the enables for the eight legacy CAM
          entries as follows:
          port0, EN = GMX_RX0_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN<7:0>]
          port1, EN = GMX_RX1_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN<15:8>]
          port2, EN = GMX_RX2_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN<23:16>]
          port3, EN = GMX_RX3_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN<31:24>]

          The full 32 indepedent per MAC enables are in
          GMX_RX_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN.

          Therefore, writes to GMX_RXX_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN]
          will be reflected in EN and writes to EN will be
          reflected in GMX_RXX_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN[EN].

          In XAUI mode, only GMX_RX0_ADR_CAM_EN is used and
          GMX_RX[1,2,3]_ADR_CAM_EN should not be used.

          GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN was not present in legacy
          GMX implemenations which had only eight DMAC CAM
          entries. New applications may choose to ignore
          GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_EN using GMX_RX_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN
          instead.

          EN represents the full 32 indepedent per MAC
          enables.

          Writes to EN will be reflected in
          GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_EN[EN] and writes to
          GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_EN[EN] will be reflected in EN.
          Refer to GMX_RXx_ADR_CAM_EN for the CSR mapping.

          In XAUI mode, only GMX_RX0_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN is used
          and GMX_RX[1,2,3]_ADR_CAM_ALL_EN should not be

      Choosing proper values of GMX_TX_PAUSE_PKT_TIME[TIME] and
      GMX_TX_PAUSE_PKT_INTERVAL[INTERVAL] can be challenging to the system
      designer.  It is suggested that TIME be much greater than INTERVAL and
      GMX_TX_PAUSE_ZERO[SEND] be set.  This allows a periodic refresh of the PAUSE
      count and then when the backpressure condition is lifted, a PAUSE packet
      with TIME==0 will be sent indicating that Octane is ready for additional
      data.
      If the system chooses to not set GMX_TX_PAUSE_ZERO[SEND], then it is
      suggested that TIME and INTERVAL are programmed such that they satisify the
      following rule...
      INTERVAL <= TIME (largest_pkt_size + IFG + pause_pkt_size)
      where largest_pkt_size is that largest packet that the system can send
      (normally 1518B), IFG is the interframe gap and pause_pkt_size is the size

          In this mode, the interface will function at
          maximum bandwidth. It is possible to for the
          TX PCS machine to drop first byte of the TX
          frame.  When GMX_TX_APPEND[PREAMBLE] is set,
          the first byte will be a preamble byte which
          can be dropped to compensate for an extended
          IPG.

          1 = Data will only be sent on even cycles.
          In this mode, there can be bandwidth
          implications when sending odd-byte packets as
          the IPG can extend an extra cycle.
          There will be no loss of data.

      It has no relationship with the TX FIFO per se.  The TX engine sends packets
      from PKO and upon completion, sends a command to the TX stats block for an
      update based on the packet size.  The stats operation can take a few cycles -
      normally not enough to be visible considering the 64B min packet size that is
      ethernet convention.
      In the rare case in which SW attempted to schedule really, really, small packets
      or the sclk (6xxx) is running ass-slow, then the stats updates may not happen in
      real time and can back up the TX engine.
      This counter is the number of cycles in which the TX engine was stalled.  In
      normal operation, it should always be zeros."
