  The USBH controller implements three kinds of CSRs:
    * UCTL RSL-type registers: 2KB starting at address    0x1_1800_6800_0000
    * UAHC NCB-type registers: 1MB starting at address    0x1_6800_0000_0000
    * UPHY indirect registers: indirect access via the UCTL_PORT*_CR_DBG_*
      registers. (See Synopsys PHY databook for details)

  == UCTL ==================================================

  UCTL registers are only accessible via RSL. They generally contain basic
  clock controls, resets, and static configuration bits for the entire USB
  subsystem. UCTL registers support 64-bit register accesses.

  Note that UCTL registers starting from 0x30 can be accessed only
  after HCLK is enabled and UCTL_RST is deasserted.

  Undefined offsets in the UCTL register region will return
  64'hFFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF on reads, writes will have no side-effects.
  No addresses should alias.

  The UCTL registers are big-endian.

  == UAHC =================================================

  UAHC registers are implemented by the Host Controller,
  access is provided to these registers over RSL or NCB. The only registers
  that may require the high-performance NCB path are the xHCI Runtime registers.
  UAHC registers only support 64-bit or 32-bit accesses.
  Note that the CSR_ENDIAN_MODE setting only applies to UAHC registers
  accessed over NCB.
  INTERNAL: Due to the nature of the xHCI drivers, it's likely that all
  register accesses from xHCI will go over NCB.

  Access to the UAHC registers follows the same rules as registers 0x30 to 0xF8
  of the UCTL. In other words, HCLK must be enabled, UCTL_RST must be deasserted.

  The UAHC registers require 1MB of address space. The interior mapping is:
    Offset                Register Type
    0x0_0000 - 0x0_7FFF   xHCI Registers (X* prefix)
      0x0000 - 0x001f       xHCI Capability Registers
      0x0020 - 0x005f       Operational Registers
      0x0420 - 0x043f       Port Registers
      0x0440 - 0x0443       Runtime Registers
      0x0460 - 0x047f       Interrupt Registers
      0x0480 - 0x0583       Doorbell Registers
      0x0880 - 0x08af       xHCI Extended Capabilities
    0x0_C100 - 0x0_C6FF   Global Registers (G* prefix)
    0x4_0000 - 0x7_FFFF   Internal RAM 0 Debug Access
    0x8_0000 - 0xB_FFFF   Internal RAM 1 Debug Access
    0xC_0000 - 0xF_FFFF   Internal RAM 2 Debug Access

  For more information about the "xHCI Registers", see the xHCI specification.
  INTERNAL: For more on "Global Registers", see Synopsys DWC_usb3 Host Controller Databook v2.50a
  sections 6.1.3 and 6.2.
  INTERNAL: For more on xHCI registers, see Synopsys DWC_usb3 Host Controller Databook v2.50a
  sections 6.1.5 and 6.4.

  UAHC registers may also be accessed by presenting an NCB-type address over
  RSL. Registers accessed this way are statically mapped from UAHC's
  little-endian mode to the RSL's big-endian.

  == UPHY =================================================

  The USB PHYs have control and status registers accessible via an indirect
  mechanism using the UCTL.PORT*_CR_DBG_* registers. For more information,
  see the PHY Databook.

          BIST fast-clear mode select. A BIST run with this bit set clears all entries in USBH RAMs
          to 0x0.
          There are 2 major modes of BIST: full and clear. Full BIST is run by the BIST state
          machine when CLEAR_BIST is deasserted during BIST. Clear BIST is run if CLEAR_BIST is
          asserted during BIST.
          To avoid race conditions, software must first perform a CSR write operation that puts the
          CLEAR_BIST setting into the correct state and then perform another CSR write operation to
          set the BIST trigger (keeping the CLEAR_BIST state constant).
          CLEAR BIST completion is indicated by UCTL(0)_BIST_STATUS[NDONE]. A BIST clear operation
          takes almost 2,000 host-controller-clock cycles for the largest RAM.

          dividers.
          Also, the UCTL, UAHC, and UPHY should be held in software- initiated reset (using
          UPHY_RST, UAHC_RST, UCTL_RST) until BIST is complete.
          BIST defect status can be checked after FULL BIST completion, both of which are indicated
          in UCTL(0)_BIST_STATUS. The full BIST run takes almost 80,000 host-controller-clock cycles

          High-speed jitter adjustment. Indicates the correction required to accommodate mac3 clock

          125us micro-frame is counted for 123933ns. The value needs to be programmed in terms of
          high-speed bit times in a 30 MHz cycle. Default value that needs to be driven is 0x20
          (assuming 30 MHz perfect clock).
          FLA connects to the FLADJ register defined in the xHCI spec in the PCI configuration
          space. Each count is equal to 16 high-speed bit times. By default when this register is
          set to 0x20, it gives 125us interval. Now, based on the clock accuracy, you can decrement
          the count or increment the count to get the 125 us uSOF window.

          This bit determines the set of burst lengths to be utilized by the master interface. It
          works in conjunction with the GSBUSCFG0[7:1] enables (INCR*BRSTENA).
          If disabled, the AXI master will use only the following burst lengths:
          1, 4, 8, 16 (assuming the INCR*BRSTENA are set to their reset values)

          Power down scale. The USB3 suspend-clock input replaces pipe3_rx_pclk as a clock source to
          a small part of the USB3 core that operates when the SuperSpeed PHY is in its lowest power
          (P3) state, and therefore does not provide a clock. This field specifies how many suspend-
          clock periods fit into a 16 kHz clock period. When performing the division, round up the
          remainder.
          For example, when using an 32-bit PHY and 25-MHz suspend clock, PWRDNSCALE = 25000 kHz/16
          kHz = 1563 (rounded up).
          The minimum suspend-clock frequency is 32 KHz, and maximum suspend-clock frequency is 125
          MHz.
          The LTSSM uses Suspend clock for 12-ms and 100-ms timers during suspend mode. According to
          the USB 3.0 specification, the accuracy on these timers is 0% to +50%. 12 ms + 0~+50%
          accuracy = 18 ms (Range is 12 ms - 18 ms)
          100 ms + 0~+50% accuracy = 150 ms (Range is 100 ms - 150 ms).
          The suspend clock accuracy requirement is:
          (12,000/62.5) * (GCTL[31:19]) * actual suspend_clk_period should be between 12,000 and
          18,000
          (100,000/62.5) * (GCTL[31:19]) * actual suspend_clk_period should be between 100,000 and
          150,000
          For example, if your suspend_clk frequency varies from 7.5 MHz to 10.5MHz, then the value
          needs to programmed is: Power Down Scale = 10500/16 = 657 (rounded up; and fastest
          frequency used).

          Synchronize ITP to reference clock. In host mode, if this bit is set to:

          This feature is useful because it saves power by suspending UTMI/ULPI when SuperSpeed only
          is active and it helps resolve when the PHY does not transmit a host resume unless it is

          1 = The link waits for 8us of LFPS before it detects a valid U2 exit.
          This bit is added to improve interoperability with a third party host controller. This
          host controller in U2 state while performing receiver detection generates an LFPS glitch
          of about 4s duration. This causes the device to exit from U2 state because the LFPS filter
          value is 248ns. With the new functionality enabled, the device can stay in U2 while
          ignoring this glitch from the host controller.

    bus: NCB
    description: |
      When the AXI Master Bus returns Error response, the SoC Bus Error is generated. In the host
      mode, the host_system_err port indicates this condition. In addition, it is also indicated in
      UAHC(0)_USBSTS[HSE]. Due to the nature of AXI, it is possible that multiple AXI transactions
      are active at a time. The Host Controller does not keep track of the start address of all
      outstanding transactions. Instead, it keeps track of the start address of the DMA transfer
      associated with all active transactions. It is this address that is reported in the
      GBUSERRADDR when a bus error occurs. For example, if the host controller initiates a DMA
      transfer to write 1k of packet data starting at buffer address 0xABCD0000, and this DMA is
      broken up into multiple 256B bursts on the AXI, then if a bus error occurs on any of these
      associated AXI transfers, the GBUSERRADDR reflects the DMA start address of 0xABCD0000
      regardless of which AXI transaction received the error.

          HS/FS timeout calibration.
          The number of PHY clock cycles, as indicated by the application in this field, is
          multiplied by a bit-time factor; this factor is added to the high-speed/full-speed
          interpacket timeout duration in the core to account for additional delays introduced by
          the PHY. This might be required, since the delay introduced by the PHY in generating the
          linestate condition can vary among PHYs.
          The USB standard timeout value for high-speed operation is 736 to 816 (inclusive) bit
          times. The USB standard timeout value for full-speed operation is 16 to 18 (inclusive) bit
          times. The application must program this field based on the speed of connection.
          The number of bit times added per PHY clock are:
          * high-speed operation:
          - one 30-MHz PHY clock = 16 bit times
          - one 60-MHz PHY clock = 8 bit times
          * full-speed operation:
          - one 30-MHz PHY clock = 0.4 bit times
          - one 60-MHz PHY clock = 0.2 bit times
          - one 48-MHz PHY clock = 0.25 bit times

          Host port compliance. Setting this bit to 1 enables placing the SS port link into a
          compliance state, which allows testing of the PIPE PHY compliance patterns without having
          to have a test fixture on the USB 3.0 cable. By default, this bit should be set to 0.
          In compliance-lab testing, the SS port link enters compliance after failing the first
          polling sequence after power on. Set this bit to 0, when you run compliance tests.
          The sequence for using this functionality is as follows:
          Disconnect any plugged in devices.
          Set UAHC_USBCMD[HCRST] = 1 or power-on-chip reset.
          Set UAHC_PORTSC[PP] = 0.
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 1. This places the link into compliance state.
          To advance the compliance pattern, follow this sequence (toggle HSTPRTCMPL):
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 0.
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 1. This advances the link to the next compliance pattern.
          To exit from the compliance state, set UAHC_USBCMD[HCRST = 1 or power-on-chip reset.

    description: |
      This register specifies the relative DMA priority level among the host TXFIFOs (one per USB
      bus instance) within the associated speed group (SuperSpeed or HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed).
      When multiple TXFIFOs compete for DMA service at a given time, the TXDMA arbiter grants access
      on a packet-basis in the following manner:
      Among the FIFOs in the same speed group (SuperSpeed or HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed):
      High-priority TXFIFOs are granted access using round-robin arbitration
      Low-priority TXFIFOs are granted access using round-robin arbitration only after high-priority
      TXFIFOs have no further processing to do (i.e., either the TXQs are empty or the corresponding
      TXFIFOs do not have the required data).
      The TX DMA arbiter prioritizes the SuperSpeed group or HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed group
      according to the ratio programmed in the UAHC(0)_GDMAHLRATIO register.
      For scatter-gather packets, the arbiter grants successive DMA requests to the same FIFO until
      the entire packet is completed. The register size corresponds to the number of configured USB
      bus instances; for example, in the default configuration, there are 3 USB bus instances (1
      SuperSpeed, 1 HighSpeed, and 1 FullSpeed/LowSpeed).

    bus: NCB
    description: |
      This register specifies the relative priority of the SuperSpeed FIFOs with respect to the
      HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed FIFOs. The DMA arbiter prioritizes the
      HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed round-robin arbiter group every DMA high-low priority ratio
      grants as indicated in the register separately for TX and RX. To illustrate, consider that all
      FIFOs are requesting access simultaneously, and the ratio is 4. SuperSpeed gets priority for 4
      packets, HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed gets priority for 1 packet, SuperSpeed gets priority for
      4 packets, HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed gets priority for 1 packet, and so on.
      If FIFOs from both speed groups are not requesting access simultaneously then,
      * If SuperSpeed got grants 4 out of the last 4 times, then HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed get
      the priority on any future request.
      * If HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed got the grant last time, SuperSpeed gets the priority on the
      next request.
      If there is a valid request on either SuperSpeed or HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed, a grant is
      always awarded; there is no idle.

          This field indicates the frame length adjustment to be applied when SOF/ITP counter is
