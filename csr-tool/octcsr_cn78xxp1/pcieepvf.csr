  The PCIEEPVF()_CFG* registers (PCICONFIGEP) can be accessed from a remote device via PCIe Port 0
  or Port 1, or they can be accessed via the PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers. Note that
  each port can directly access only its local EP PCIe configuration registers via standard PCIe
  configuration read/write operations. When accessing the PCIEEPVF()_CFG* registers via the
  PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers, the ADDR field must match the PCIe configuration space
  address.
  PCIEEPVF Registers lists the PCICONFIGEP registers.

  Note that the RO/WRSL field access type applies to PCICONFIGEP registers only. The RO/WRSL
  fields are RO if accessed from the physical PCIe port, and R/W if accessed via
  PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD.

          * To send a specific PCI Express message, the application writes the payload of the
          message into this register, then sets bit 0 of the port link control register to send the
          message.

          * To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all TLPs, the application
          places a 32-bit corruption pattern into this register and enables this function by setting
          bit 25 of the port link control register. When enabled, the transmit LCRC result is XORed
          with this pattern before inserting it into the packet.

          N_FTS. Sets the number of fast training sequences (N_FTS) that the core advertises as its
          N_FTS during GEN2 Link training. This value is used to inform the link partner about the
          PHY's ability to recover synchronization after a low power state.

          Do not set N_FTS to zero; doing so can cause the LTSSM to go into the recovery state when
          exiting from L0s.
