          When SWITCH_EXE is 0, the operating modes are updated directly without performing any
          SWITCH operations. This allows software to perform the SWITCH operations manually, then
          update the hardware.
          Software writes this bit to a 1 to indicate that hardware should perform the necessary
          SWITCH operations.
          First, the POWER_CLASS switch is performed. If it fails, SWITCH_ERR0 is set and the
          remaining SWITCH operations are not performed. If it succeeds, the POWER_CLASS field is
          updated and the HS_TIMING switch is performed.
          If the HS_TIMING switch fails, SWITCH_ERR1 is set and the remaining SWITCH operations are
          not performed. If it succeeds, the HS_TIMING field is updated and the BUS_WIDTH switch
          operation is performed.
          If the BUS_WIDTH switch operation fails, SWITCH_ERR2 is set. If it succeeds, the BUS_WITDH
          is updated.
          Changes to CLK_HI and CLK_LO are discarded if any SWITCH_ERR occurs.
