Interacting with the Bringup and Diagnostic Kit
===============================================

Overview
--------

The "Bringup and Diagnostic Kit" (BDK) is a set of executables and
scripts designed to ease the bringup of new hardware based on Cavium
Networks line of OCTEON processors.  This document covers the usage of
the BDK from an interactive console after the BDK has been installed.
For installation information, see the document link:bdk.html[Bringup and
Diagnostic Kit].

Navigating Menus and Answering Prompts
--------------------------------------

All menus in the BDK start with a banner followed by a list of
numbered options.  Options are chosen by typing the associated number
into the "Menu Choice:" prompt and pressing ENTER.  Leaving a prompt
blank signals that input should be aborted, passing control passes
back to the menu.  All menus have the last option as an exit of the
menu and return to the previous menu.

Some menu options require extra input from the user.  These accept
keyboard input followed by the ENTER key.  Leaving a field blank, or
hitting Control-C abort input.  Control goes back to the menu.
Numeric input can be in decimal (default) or hexadecimal by beginning
the number with "0x" (zero followed by "x", similar to the C
programming language).

Line Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any prompt ending with ">" supports full line editing and history. Generally
speaking, arrow keys, home, end, insert, and delete work as expected.

* Use 'ARROW KEYS', 'HOME', 'END' or *vi* style commands 'ESC-h', 'ESC-j', 'ESC-k', 'ESC-l', 'ESC-0', 'ESC-$', 'ESC-w', or 'ESC-b' for navigation.
* Scroll through previous commands using the 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrow keys.
* Use 'INSERT' to toggle insert/overwrite mode, 'DELETE' to delete, 'F1' for help.
* Many *vi* style modes are available for command and history navigation.
* Use 'TAB' for command completion, multiple to cycle, or 'CTRL-D' for a list of possible commands.
* Use 'ESC-i', 'ESC-A' ,'ESC-a', 'ESC-c' for insert mode, 'ESC-R', 'ESC-r' for overwrite mode (behavior like *vi*).
* Use '!!', '!<num>' or '!<string>' to repeat previous commands in the history.
* Use '::', ':<num>' or ':<string>' to recall previous commands in the history to current.
* Use '?<string>', '/<string>', 'ESC-?<string>', 'ESC-/<string>', 'ESC-n', 'ESC-N' to also recall to current.
* Use 'CTRL-l' erase the screen, 'ESC-D' to clear the rest of the current line.
* Use 'ESC-d<movement>' to delete, 'ESC-~' to change case, 'ESC-u' to undo (one level).
* See the *vi* man page for more info on the operation of various commands.

Getting started at the Main Menu
--------------------------------

After initial boot, the BDK displays the first, or main, menu.  This
provides a list of high level options that are available
interactively.  Most menu choices bringup sub menus of additional
options.

Each menu option supports a logically distinct set of options:

Configuration options::

Use this option to configure the BDK for your board.  The specifics of
PHY addresses, MAC addresses, etc change for each board.  See
<<CONFIGURE, Configuring the BDK for your Board>>.

File options::

Here you'll find options for dealing with the BDK virtual filesystem.
These are normally most useful when writing scripts for the BDK.

Flash options::

Option for dealing with a NOR flash connected to chip select 0.

DDR options::

Options for configuring DDR3.

PCIe options::

PCIe discovery, enumeration, and probing can be accessed through this
menu. See <<PCIE, Testing PCIe>>.

TWSI options::

Scan or probe TWSI bus devices.

SMI/MDIO options::

Scan or probe SMI/MDIO bus devices.

Interactive Lua prompt::

This provides direct access to the Lua interpreter running in the BDK.
This can be used to probe and configure any type of hardware inside or
connected to OCTEON.  Scripting using Lua is cover in another
document.

Traffic Generator::

This menu option starts a simple traffic generator on OCTEON.  It can
be used to transmit and receive packets on all OCTEON packet
interfaces.  In combination with an external loopback, this can
quickly verify the interfaces on a board.

Reboot::

Perform a soft reset of OCTEON.  This can be useful for a quick reboot
without power cycling the entire board.
