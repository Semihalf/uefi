          DLCCLEAR_BIST must be written to 1 before DLCSTART_BIST is written to 1 using a separate
          CSR write.
          DLCCLEAR_BIST must not be changed after writing DLCSTART_BIST 0->1 until the BIST

          This bit should only be written after DCLK has been enabled by software and is stable.
          (See LMC initialization routine for details on how to enable the DDR3/4 memory
          (DCLK)--which requires LMC PLL init, clock divider, and proper DLL initialization

          Replication mode enable.
          This is used by the memory controller to support graph data in multiple ports (or port
          sets), so that the least full port can be selected to minimize latency effects.
          Software Note: Using this mode requires the HFA software compiler and HFA driver to be
          aware of the address replication changes. This involves changes to the MLOAD/GWALK HFA
          instruction format (See IWORD2.SREPL), as well as changes to node arc and metadata
          definitions which support an additional REPL field. When clear, replication mode is
          disabled, and HFA interprets HFA instructions and node-arc formats which do not have
          address replication information.

          Cluster cripple mask. A 1 in each bit of the mask represents which HTE cluster to cripple.
          CN78XX has four clusters (therefore CLMSKCRIP<3:0> are used.)
          The MIO_FUS_DFA_CLMASK_CRIPPLE[3:0] fuse bits are forced into this register at reset. Any
          fuse bits that contain 1 are disallowed during a write and are always read as 1.

          Encoding that represents the number of HTEs to cripple for each cluster. Typically
          DTE_CLCRIP = 0, which enables all HTEs within each cluster. However, when the HFA
          performance counters are used, software may want to limit the number of HTEs per cluster
          available, as there are only four parallel performance counters.
          DTE_CLCRIP No. of HTEs crippled (per cluster)
          0 0 HTE[15:0]:ON
          1 1/2 HTE[15:8]:OFF  /HTE[7:0]:ON

          7 7/8 HTE[15:2]:OFF  /HTE[1:0]:ON
          Higher numbered HTEs are crippled first. For instance, on CN78XX (with 16 HTEs/cluster),
          if DTE_CLCRIP = 1 (1/4), then [15:8] within the cluster are crippled and only HTE numbers
          [7:0] are available.
          The MIO_FUS_DFA_NUMDTE_CRIPPLE[3:0] fuse bits are forced into this register at reset. Any

          HFA clock disable source. When set, the HFA clocks for HTE (thread engine) operations are
          disabled to conserve overall chip clocking power when the HFA function is not used.
          When set, software must never issue IOI-direct CSR operations to the HFA (will result in
          IOI timeout errors).
          This should only be written to a different value during power-on software initialization.
          The MIO_FUS_DFA_DTE_DISABLE fuse bit is forced into this register at reset. If the fuse
          bit contains 1, write operations to DTECLKDIS are disallowed and are always read as 1.

          HFA illegal replication factor error. HFA only supports 1*, 2*, and 4* port replication.
          Legal configurations for memory are to support 2 port or 4 port configurations.
          The REPLERR interrupt is set in the following illegal configuration cases:
          An 8* replication factor is detected for any memory reference.
          A 4* replication factor is detected for any memory reference when only 2 memory ports are
          enabled.
          If REPLERR is set during a HFA graph walk operation, the walk prematurely terminates with
          RWORD0[REA]=ERR. If REPLERR is set during a IOI-direct CSR read access to HFA memory
          region, the CSR read response data is unpredictable.

          HFA nonexistent memory access. HTEs (and backdoor CSR HFA memory region reads) have access
          to the following 40-bit L2/DRAM address space, which maps to a 38-bit physical DDR3/4
          SDRAM address space.
          DR0: 0x0 0000 0000 0000 to 0x0 0000 0FFF FFFF

          DR1: 0x0 0000 2000 0000 to 0x0 0020 0FFF FFFF
          maps to upper 127.75GB of DDR3/4 SDRAM
          In the event the HFA generates a reference to the L2/DRAM address hole (0x0000.0FFF.FFFF -
          0x0000.1FFF.FFFF) or to an address above 0x0020.0FFF.FFFF, the DFANXM programmable

          Software Note:
          Both the 1) software HFA graph compiler and the 2) software IOI-direct CSR accesses to HFA
          memory region must avoid making references to these nonexistent memory regions.
          If DFANXM is set during a HFA graph walk operation, the walk is prematurely terminated
          with RWORD0[REA]=ERR. If DFANXM is set during a IOI-direct CSR read access to HFA memory
          region, the CSR read response data is forced to
          128'hBADE_FEED_DEAD_BEEF_FACE_CAFE_BEAD_C0DE. (The 64-bit doubleword being accessed,

          written into the HFA instruction FIFO (DIF) in main memory. Each HFA instruction contains
          a fixed size 64-byte instruction word which is executed by the HFA hardware.
          The DBL register can hold up to 1M-1 (2^20-1) pending HFA instruction requests. During a
          read (by software), the 'most recent' contents of the DFA_DBELL register are returned at
          the time the IOI-INB bus is driven.
          Since HFA hardware updates this register, its contents are unpredictable in software.

    description: |
      To write to DFA_DIFRDPTR, a device issues an IOBST request directed at the HFA with
      addr[34:33] = 0x1. To read DFA_DIFRDPTR, a device issues an IOBLD64 request directed at the
      HFA with addr[34:33] = 0x1.
      If DFA_CONFIG[DTECLKDIS] = 1 (i.e. HFA-HTE clocks are disabled) or if FUSE[90] = 'HFA HTE
      disable' is blown, read/write operations to DFA_DIFRDPTR do not take effect.

        description: |
          Represents the 64-byte-aligned address of the current instruction in the HFA Instruction
          FIFO in main memory. The RDPTR must be seeded by software at boot time, and is then
          maintained thereafter by HFA hardware. During the seed write operation (by software),
          RDPTR<6:5> = 0, since HFA instruction chunks must be 128-byte-aligned. During a read
          operation (by software), the most-recent contents of the RDPTR register are returned at
          the time the IOI-INB bus is driven.
          Since HFA hardware updates this register, its contents are unpredictable in software
          (unless it is guaranteed that no new doorbell register write operations have occurred and
          the doorbell register is read as zero).

    description: |
      To write to DFA_DIFCTL, a device issues an IOBST request directed at the HFA with addr[34:32]
      = 0x6. To read DFA_DIFCTL, a device issues an IOBLD64 request directed at the HFA with
      addr[34:32] = 0x6. This register is intended to only be written once (at power-up). Any future
      write operations could cause the HFA and FPA hardware to become unpredictable.
      If DFA_CONFIG[DTECLKDIS] = 1 (i.e. HFA-HTE clocks are disabled) or if FUSE[90] = 'HFA HTE
      disable' is blown, read/write operations to DFA_DIFCTL do not take effect.

          Load don't write back. When set, the hardware issues LDWB command towards the cache when
          fetching the last word of instructions; as a result the line will not be written back when
          replaced.
          When clear, the hardware issues regular load towards the cache, which will cause the line
          to be written back before being replaced.

          Represents the number of 64-byte instructions contained within each HFA instruction chunk.
          At power-on, software seeds the SIZE register with a fixed chunk-size (must be at least
          0x3). HFA hardware uses this field to determine the size of each HFA instruction chunk, in
          order to:
          a) determine when to read the next HFA instruction chunk pointer which is written by
          software at the end of the current HFA instruction chunk (see HFA description of next
          chunk buffer Ptr for format).
          b) determine when a HFA instruction chunk can be returned to the free page list maintained
          by the FPA hardware.
