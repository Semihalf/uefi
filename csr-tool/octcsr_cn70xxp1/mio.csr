          General timer 0-3 interrupts.
          When CIU_TIM_MULTI_CAST[EN] == 0, this interrupt is
          common for all PP/IRQs, writing '1' to any PP/IRQ
          will clear all TIMERx(x=0..9) interrupts.
          When CIU_TIM_MULTI_CAST[EN] == 1, TIMERx(x=0..9)

          enable bit in CIU_INTx_EN is set, where x

          SUM1&EN1 summary bit
          This read-only bit reads as a one whenever any
          CIU_SUM1_PP@_IPx (CIU_SUM1_IO@_INT)  bit is set
          and corresponding enable bit in CIU_INTx_EN is set
          PPs use CIU_INTx_SUM0 where x=0-19
          PCIe uses the CIU_INTx_SUM0 where x=32-33.
          Note that WDOG_SUM only summarizes the SUM1/EN1
          result and does not have a corresponding enable
          bit, so does not directly contribute to
          interrupts.

    title: MIO Boot Region Config Register (1 per region * 8 regions)
    address: 0x1180000000000
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      Contains region enable, region or, region ALE/SAM mode, region width, region size, and region
      base
      address parameters.
      DMACK, if non-zero, will assert the corresponding boot_dmack[n] pin when an access to this
      region
      is performed.  DMACK is encoded as follows: 0 = disabled, 1 = boot_dmack[0], 2 =
      boot_dmack[1].
      This is useful for CF cards in PC card memory mode that support DMA because the -REG and
      -DMACK pins
      are shared.  Note: the assertion level of boot_dmack is specified by
      MIO_BOOT_DMA_TIMn[DMACK_PI].
      TIM_MULT specifies the timing multiplier for a region.  The timing multiplier applies to all
      timing
      parameters, except for WAIT and RD_DLY, which simply count eclks.  TIM_MULT is encoded as
      follows:
      0 = 4x, 1 = 1x, 2 = 2x, 3 = 8x.
      RD_DLY specifies the read sample delay in eclk cycles for a region.  For reads, the data bus
      is
      normally sampled on the same eclk edge that drives boot_oe_n to the inactive state (or the
      sclk edge that toggles the lower address bits in page mode).  This parameter can delay that
      sampling
      edge by up to 7 sclks.  Note: the number of eclk cycles counted by the PAGE and RD_HLD timing
      parameters
      must be greater than RD_DLY.
      Region or bit will assert the given region's chip enable when there is an address hit in the
      previous
      region (no function for region 0, since there is no previous region).  This is useful for CF
      cards
      because it allows the use of 2 separate timing configurations for common memory and attribute
      memory.
      ALE (address latch enable) mode enables the multiplexed address/data bus mode.  This is the
      only
      mode supported for 70xx.
      SAM (strobe AND mode) internally combines the output enable and write enable strobes into a
      single
      strobe that is then driven onto both boot_oe_n and boot_we_n.  This is useful for parts that
      use a single strobe along with a read/write bit (the read/write bit can be driven from an
      address
      pin).
      Bus width is fixed at 8 bits.
      Region size is in 64k blocks and in -1 notation (i.e. 0 = 1 64k block, 1 = 2 64k blocks,
      etc.).
      Base address specifies address bits [31:16] of the first 64k block of the region.
      Note: When region 0 is defined to be NAND flash, only MIO_BOOT_REG_CFG0[EN],
      MIO_BOOT_REG_CFG0[SIZE],
      and MIO_BOOT_REG_CFG0[BASE] remain functional.  All other fields in MIO_BOOT_REG_CFG0 have no
      effect.

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      The hardware allows only one controller to use the BootBus and the MIO_NDF_DMA engine
      at a time.  The SEL field determines the owner.
      This field should be changed only when the current controller operations are complete.
      Here are several situations.
         1.  If eMMC/SD is currently doing a read or write command without a DMA then the
             MIO_EMM_INT[CMD_DONE] should occur before SEL is changed.
         2.  If eMMC/SD is currently doing a dma operation with the device then the
             MIO_EMM_INT[DMA_DONE] should occur before SEL is changed.  Care must be taken not to
             reprogram the MIO_NDF_DMA_CFG register until both the previous MIO_NDF_DMA_INT[DONE]
             has occurred and the new SEL has been set.
         3.  If NAND is currently doing one or more operations to the external device without using
             the DMA then the NDF_INT[EMPTY] should occur to guarantee all commands are executed
             before changing the SEL value.
         4.  If NAND is currently doing one or more operations to the external device which includes
             DMAs then the SEL should not change until both the last MIO_NDF_DMA_INT[DONE] and
             NDF_INT[EMPTY] have occurred.

      MIO_UART@_RBR = MIO UART@ Receive Buffer Register
      The Receive Buffer Register (RBR) is a read-only register that contains the data byte received
      on the
      serial input port (sin). The data in this register is valid only if the Data Ready (DR) bit in
      the
      Line status Register (LSR) is set. When the FIFOs are programmed OFF, the data in the RBR must
      be
      read before the next data arrives, otherwise it is overwritten, resulting in an overrun error.
      When the FIFOs are programmed ON, this register accesses the head of the receive FIFO. If the
      receive FIFO is full (64 characters) and this register is not read before the next data
      character arrives,
      then the data already in the FIFO is preserved, but any incoming data is lost. An overrun
      error also
      occurs. Note: The Divisor Latch Address Bit (DLAB) of the Line Control Register (LCR) must be
      clear to
      access this register. Note: The address below is an alias to simplify these CSR descriptions.
      It should be known
      that the RBR, THR, and DLL registers are the same.

    description: |
      The Line Control Register (LCR) controls the format of the data that is transmitted and
      received by the UART.
      LCR bits 0 and 1 are the Character Length Select field. This field is used to select the
      number of data bits per character that are transmitted and received. See the following table
      for encodings:
      CLS
      ---
      00 = 5 bits (bits 0-4 sent)
      01 = 6 bits (bits 0-5 sent)
      10 = 7 bits (bits 0-6 sent)
      11 = 8 bits (all bits sent)
      LCR bit 2 controls the number of stop bits transmitted. If bit 2 is a '0', one stop bit is
      transmitted in the serial data. If bit 2 is a '1' and the data bits are set to '00', one and
      a half stop bits are generated. Otherwise, two stop bits are generated and transmitted in the
      serial data out. Note that regardless of the number of stop bits selected the receiver will
      only
      check the first stop bit.
      LCR bit 3 is the Parity Enable bit. This bit is used to enable and disable parity generation
      and detection in transmitted and received serial character respectively.
      LCR bit 4 is the Even Parity Select bit. If parity is enabled, bit 4 selects between even and
      odd parity. If bit 4 is a '1', an even number of ones is transmitted or checked. If bit 4 is a
      '0', an odd number of ones is transmitted or checked.
      LCR bit 6 is the Break Control bit. Setting the Break bit sends a break signal by holding the
      sout line low (when not in Loopback mode, as determined by Modem Control Register bit 4). When
      in Loopback mode, the break condition is internally looped back to the receiver.
      LCR bit 7 is the Divisor Latch Address bit. Setting this bit enables reading and writing of
      the Divisor Latch register (DLL and DLH) to set the baud rate of the UART. This bit must be
      cleared after initial baud rate setup in order to access other registers.
      Note: The LCR is writeable only when the UART is not busy (when the BUSY bit (bit 0) of the
      UART
      Status Register (USR) is clear). The LCR is always readable and writable because the BUSY bit
      is always clear.

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      The lower four bits of the Modem Control Register (MCR) directly manipulate the outputs of the
      UART.
      The DTR (bit 0), RTS (bit 1), OUT1 (bit 2), and OUT2 (bit 3) bits are inverted and then drive
      the corresponding UART outputs, dtr_n, rts_n, out1_n, and out2_n.  In loopback mode, these
      outputs
      are driven inactive high while the values in these locations are internally looped back to the
      inputs.
      Note: When Auto RTS is enabled, the rts_n output is controlled in the same way, but is also
      gated with the receiver FIFO threshold trigger (rts_n is inactive high when above the
      threshold).
      The rts_n output will be de-asserted whenever RTS (bit 1) is set low.
      Note: The UART0 out1_n and out2_n outputs are not present on the pins of the chip, but the
      UART0 OUT1 and OUT2 bits still function in Loopback mode.  The UART1 dtr_n, out1_n, and out2_n
      outputs
      are not present on the pins of the chip, but the UART1 DTR, OUT1, and OUT2 bits still function
      in
      Loopback mode.
      MCR bit 4 is the Loopback bit. When set, data on the sout line is held high, while serial data
      output is looped back to the sin line, internally. In this mode all the interrupts are fully
      functional. This feature is used for diagnostic purposes. Also, in loopback mode, the modem
      control
      inputs (dsr_n, cts_n, ri_n, dcd_n) are disconnected and the four modem control outputs (dtr_n,
      rts_n,
      out1_n, out1_n) are looped back to the inputs, internally.
      MCR bit 5 is the Auto Flow Control Enable (AFCE) bit. When FIFOs are enabled and this bit is
      set, 16750-compatible Auto RTS and Auto CTS serial data flow control features are enabled.
      Auto RTS becomes active when the following occurs:
      1. MCR bit 1 is set
      2. FIFOs are enabled by setting FIFO Control Register (FCR) bit 0
      3. MCR bit 5 is set (must be set after FCR bit 0)
      When active, the rts_n output is forced inactive-high when the receiver FIFO level reaches the
      threshold set by FCR[7:6]. When rts_n is connected to the cts_n input of another UART device,
      the other UART stops sending serial data until the receiver FIFO has available space.
      The selectable receiver FIFO threshold values are: 1, 1/4, 1/2, and 2 less than full. Since
      one additional character may be transmitted to the UART after rts_n has become inactive (due
      to
      data already having entered the transmitter block in the other UART), setting the threshold to
      2
      less than full allows maximum use of the FIFO with a safety zone of one character.
      Once the receiver FIFO becomes completely empty by reading the Receiver Buffer Register (RBR),
      rts_n again becomes active-low, signalling the other UART to continue sending data. It is
      important
      to note that, even if everything else is set to Enabled and the correct MCR bits are set, if
      the FIFOs
      are disabled through FCR[0], Auto Flow Control is also disabled. When Auto RTS is disabled or
      inactive, rts_n is controlled solely by MCR[1].
      Auto CTS becomes active when the following occurs:
      1. FIFOs are enabled by setting FIFO Control Register (FCR) bit 0
      2. MCR bit 5 is set (must be set after FCR bit 0)
      When active, the UART transmitter is disabled whenever the cts_n input becomes inactive-high.
      This prevents overflowing the FIFO of the receiving UART.
      Note that, if the cts_n input is not inactivated before the middle of the last stop bit,
      another character is transmitted before the transmitter is disabled. While the transmitter is
      disabled, the transmitter FIFO can still be written to, and even overflowed. Therefore, when
      using this
      mode, either the true FIFO depth (64 characters) must be known to software, or the
      Programmable THRE
      Interrupt mode must be enabled to access the FIFO full status through the Line Status
      Register. When using
      the FIFO full status, software can poll this before each write to the Transmitter FIFO.
      Note: FIFO full status is also available in the UART Status Register (USR) or the actual level
      of the FIFO may be read through the Transmit FIFO Level (TFL) register.
      When the cts_n input becomes active-low again, transmission resumes. It is important to note
      that, even if everything else is set to Enabled, Auto Flow Control is also disabled if the
      FIFOs are
      disabled through FCR[0]. When Auto CTS is disabled or inactive, the transmitter is unaffected
      by cts_n.

      in the
      non-FIFO mode, or when the receiver FIFO is empty, in FIFO mode.
      LSR bit 1 is the Overrun Error (OE) bit. When set, this bit indicates an overrun error has
      occurred because a new data character was received before the previous data was read. In the
      non-FIFO
      mode, the OE bit is set when a new character arrives in the receiver before the previous
      character was
      read from the RBR. When this happens, the data in the RBR is overwritten. In the FIFO mode, an
      overrun
      error occurs when the FIFO is full and a new character arrives at the receiver. The data in
      the FIFO
      is retained and the data in the receive shift register is lost.
      LSR bit 2 is the Parity Error (PE) bit. This bit is set whenever there is a parity error in
      the receiver if the Parity Enable (PEN) bit in the LCR is set. In the FIFO mode, since the
      parity
      error is associated with a character received, it is revealed when the character with the
      parity error
      arrives at the top of the FIFO. It should be noted that the Parity Error (PE) bit will be set
      if a
      break interrupt has occurred, as indicated by the Break Interrupt (BI) bit.
      LSR bit 3 is the Framing Error (FE) bit. This bit is set whenever there is a framing error in
      the receiver. A framing error occurs when the receiver does not detect a valid STOP bit in the
      received data. In the FIFO mode, since the framing error is associated with a character
      received, it is
      revealed when the character with the framing error is at the top of the FIFO. When a framing
      error occurs the UART will try resynchronize. It does this by assuming that the error was due
      to the
      start bit of the next character and then continues receiving the other bits (i.e. data and/or
      parity
      and stop). It should be noted that the Framing Error (FE) bit will be set if a break interrupt
      has
      occurred, as indicated by the Break Interrupt (BI) bit.
      Note: The OE, PE, and FE bits are reset when a read of the LSR is performed.
      LSR bit 4 is the Break Interrupt (BI) bit. This bit is set whenever the serial input (sin) is
      held in a 0 state for longer than the sum of start time + data bits + parity + stop bits. A
      break
      condition on sin causes one and only one character, consisting of all zeros, to be received by
      the UART. In
      the FIFO mode, the character associated with the break condition is carried through the FIFO
      and
      is revealed when the character is at the top of the FIFO. Reading the LSR clears the BI bit.
      In
      the non-FIFO mode, the BI indication occurs immediately and persists until the LSR is read.
      LSR bit 5 is the Transmitter Holding Register Empty (THRE) bit. When Programmable THRE
      Interrupt mode is disabled, this bit indicates that the UART can accept a new character for
      transmission.
      This bit is set whenever data is transferred from the THR (or TX FIFO) to the transmitter
      shift register
      and no new data has been written to the THR (or TX FIFO). This also causes a THRE Interrupt to
      occur,
      if the THRE Interrupt is enabled. When FIFOs and Programmable THRE Interrupt mode are enabled,
      LSR
      bit 5 functionality is switched to indicate the transmitter FIFO is full, and no longer
      controls
      THRE Interrupts, which are then controlled by the FCR[5:4] threshold setting.
      LSR bit 6 is the Transmitter Empty (TEMT) bit. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set whenever the
      Transmitter Shift Register and the FIFO are both empty. In the non-FIFO mode, this bit is set
      whenever the Transmitter Holding Register and the Transmitter Shift Register are both empty.
      This bit
      is typically used to make sure it is safe to change control registers. Changing control
      registers
      while the transmitter is busy can result in corrupt data being transmitted.
      LSR bit 7 is the Error in Receiver FIFO (FERR) bit. This bit is active only when FIFOs are
      enabled. It is set when there is at least one parity error, framing error, or break indication
      in the
      FIFO. This bit is cleared when the LSR is read and the character with the error is at the top
      of the
      receiver FIFO and there are no subsequent errors in the FIFO.

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      The Modem Status Register (MSR) contains the current status of the modem control input lines
      and if they changed.
      DCTS (bit 0), DDSR (bit 1), and DDCD (bit 3) bits record whether the modem control lines
      (cts_n, dsr_n, and dcd_n) have changed since the last time the user read the MSR. TERI (bit 2)
      indicates ri_n has changed from an active-low, to an inactive-high state since the last time
      the MSR was
      read. In Loopback mode, DCTS reflects changes on MCR bit 1 (RTS), DDSR reflects changes on MCR
      bit 0
      (DTR), and DDCD reflects changes on MCR bit 3 (Out2), while TERI reflects when MCR bit 2
      (Out1) has
      changed state from a high to a low.
      Note: if the DCTS bit is not set and the cts_n signal is asserted (low) and a reset occurs
      (software or otherwise), then the DCTS bit will get set when the reset is removed if the cts_n
      signal
      remains asserted.
      The CTS, DSR, RI, and DCD Modem Status bits contain information on the current state of the
      modem control lines. CTS (bit 4) is the compliment of cts_n, DSR (bit 5) is the compliment of
      dsr_n,
      RI (bit 6) is the compliment of ri_n, and DCD (bit 7) is the compliment of dcd_n. In Loopback
      mode, CTS is the same as MCR bit 1 (RTS), DSR is the same as MCR bit 0 (DTR), RI is the same
      as MCR bit
      2 (Out1), and DCD is the same as MCR bit 3 (Out2).
      Note: The UART0 dsr_n and ri_n inputs are internally tied to power and not present on the pins
      of chip. Thus the UART0 DSR and RI bits will be '0' when not in Loopback mode.  The UART1
      dsr_n, ri_n,
      and dcd_n inputs are internally tied to power and not present on the pins of chip. Thus the
      UART1 DSR,
      RI, and DCD bits will be '0' when not in Loopback mode.

    description: |
      Transmit Holding Register (THR) is a write-only register that contains data to be transmitted
      on the serial output port (sout). Data can be written to the THR any time that the THR Empty
      (THRE)
      bit of the Line Status Register (LSR) is set.
      If FIFOs are not enabled and THRE is set, writing a single character to the THR clears the
      THRE. Any additional writes to the THR before the THRE is set again causes the THR data to be
      overwritten. If FIFOs are enabled and THRE is set (and Programmable THRE mode disabled), 64
      characters of
      data may be written to the THR before the FIFO is full. Any attempt to write data when the
      FIFO is full
      results in the write data being lost.
      Note: The Divisor Latch Address Bit (DLAB) of the Line Control Register (LCR) must be clear to
      access this register.
      Note: The address below is an alias to simplify these CSR descriptions. It should be known

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      The FIFO Control Register (FCR) is a write-only register that controls the read and write data
      FIFO operation. When FIFOs and Programmable THRE Interrupt mode are enabled, this register
      also
      controls the THRE Interrupt empty threshold level.
      Setting bit 0 of the FCR enables the transmit and receive FIFOs. Whenever the value of this
      bit is changed both the TX and RX FIFOs will be reset.
      Writing a '1' to bit 1 of the FCR resets and flushes data in the receive FIFO. Note that this
      bit is self-clearing and it is not necessary to clear this bit.
      Writing a '1' to bit 2 of the FCR resets and flushes data in the transmit FIFO. Note that this
      bit is self-clearing and it is not necessary to clear this bit.
      If the FIFOs and Programmable THRE Interrupt mode are enabled, bits 4 and 5 control the empty
      threshold level at which THRE Interrupts are generated when the mode is active.  See the
      following table for encodings:
      TX Trigger
      ----------
      00 = empty FIFO
      01 = 2 chars in FIFO
      10 = FIFO 1/4 full
      11 = FIFO 1/2 full
      If the FIFO mode is enabled (bit 0 of the FCR is set to '1') bits 6 and 7 are active. Bit 6
      and bit 7 set the trigger level in the receiver FIFO for the Enable Received Data Available
      Interrupt
      (ERBFI). In auto flow control mode the trigger is used to determine when the rts_n signal will
      be
      deasserted. See the following table for encodings:
      RX Trigger
      ----------
      00 = 1 char in FIFO

      The UART Status Register (USR) contains UART status information.
      USR bit 0 is the BUSY bit.  When set this bit indicates that a serial transfer is in progress,
      when clear it indicates that the UART is idle or inactive.
      Note: The BUSY bit will always be clear.
      USR bits 1-4 indicate the following FIFO status: TX FIFO Not Full (TFNF), TX FIFO Empty (TFE),
      RX FIFO Not Empty (RFNE), and RX FIFO Full (RFF).

    description: |
      This register contains the TWSI interrupt enable mask and the interrupt source bits.  Note:
      the interrupt source bit for the TWSI core interrupt (CORE_INT) is read-only, the appropriate
      sequence must be written to the TWSI core to clear this interrupt.  The other interrupt source
      bits are
      write-one-to-clear.  TS_INT is set on the update of the MIO_TWS_TWSI_SW register (i.e. when it
      is
      written by a TWSI device).  ST_INT is set whenever the valid bit of the MIO_TWS_SW_TWSI is
      cleared
      (see above for reasons).
      Note: When using the high-level controller, CORE_EN should be clear and CORE_INT should be
      ignored.
      Conversely, when the high-level controller is disabled, ST_EN / TS_EN should be clear and
      ST_INT / TS_INT should be ignored.
      This register also contains a read-only copy of the TWSI bus (SCL and SDA) as well as control
      bits to override the current state of the TWSI bus (SCL_OVR and SDA_OVR).  Setting an override
      bit
      high will result in the open drain driver being activated, thus driving the corresponding
      signal low.

          Maximum number of CLK_CNT cycles to wait for the card to return a response, read data, or
          the 3-bit CRC status token following write data.  The following timeouts are detected:

          1. Expected response to a command doesn't occur causing MIO_EMM_RSP_STS[RSP_TIMEOUT]

          2. On a read command, expected data isn't returned causing MIO_EMM_RSP_STS[BLK_TIMEOUT]

          3. On a multi read command, expected data isn't returned causing
          MIO_EMM_RSP_STS[BLK_TIMEOUT]

          4. On a write command, expected token to a write block isn't received causing
          MIO_EMM_RSP_STS[BLK_TIMEOUT]

          5. If a stop command is issued by the hardware and no response is returned causing
          MIO_EMM_RSP_STS[STP_TIMEOUT]

          Issues this timeout doesn't cover are stalls induced by the card which are not limited by
          the specifications.  For example, when a write multi command is issued to the card and a
          block (not the last) is transferred the card can "stall" the Octeon by forcing
          emmc_data<0> low for as long as it wants to free up buffer space.  The second case is when
          the last block of a write or multi write is being transferred and the card elects to
          perform some background tasks.  The same stall mechanism with emmc_data<0> is used but
          this can last for an extend time period.
