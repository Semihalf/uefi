      Tree Access Table Entry as seen by software during 128-bit table read/write accesses.
      Indexed by TIC's hit-address. Contains the Tree Root Tnodes (1 big or 2 basic tnodes
      per TAT entry) associated with the Key Request. Used by TWE engines to start sub-tree
      walk(s). There are 192 entries in the TAT.

          Sub-Tree Super-Tuple Mode: Used to determine how to encode sub-tree node arc's dimmsk(9)
      bit
          encodings for 9x and 16x dimension support.
             0: 1x super-tuple Mode: (MAX Dimensions=9) each bit of dimmsk<8:0> specifies 1(of
      9(MAX) total
                dimensions) in single-tuple.
             1: 2x Super-tuple Mode: dimmsk<8> specifies which 1(of 2) super-tuples, where each
      super-tuple
                contains upto 8(max) dimensions for 16(MAX) total dimensions.
                If STUP==1: Indicates this sub-tree supports upto 16 dimensions(max). At each

      The Key Request's 9-bit TIC_ID is CAM'ed against all entries in the TIC,

          Enable masking of bmr_sel[0] when a Lookup request enables
          BMR for a 160-bit mask (bmr_mode = 0x2).
          If this bit is clear the bmr_sel field of the lookup will be
          preserved for 160-bit mask lookups, allowing for 4 160-bit
          BMR masks.
          If this bit is set only 2 160-bit BMR masks (determined by
          bmr_sel[1]) are supported.

      Information is only logged to this CSR if the bit corresponding to the ERROR_ID
      is set in ASE_LUE_ERROR_LOG_ENABLE.

      The contents of this CSR are invalid if no fields are set in ASE_*_INT[LUE*].

      The contents of this CSR are retained until all the bits in the ASE_*_INT[LUE*]
      are cleared, or an error occurs that is of higher-priority than the error for
      which information is currently logged by this CSR.

      The priority of the error is encoded by the enumerated values in ASE_LUE_ERROR_ID_E.
      The highest priority error is KDT_DBE, the lowest is BMT_SBE.
      For RFT and BMT errors, if multiple errors of equal weight are reported
      during a clock cycle, the error on the local RFT is reported with highest
      priority, followed by RMC0, RMC1, RMC2, RMC3.

      Only interrupts listed in ASE_LUE_ERROR_ID_E log errors.
