The files in this directory are binary images for running on OCTEON
targets.  Each image is a composite of other images generated by
bdk-update-all. Use bdk-update-all to update these images if you add
or change and Lua files.

bdk-boot-nor-cn70xx.bin:

Image for booting a CN70XX or CN71XX part using parallel NOR. Burn this
to flash at the beginning of flash.

bdk-chip-screen-cn70xx.bin:

This is an example image based on rom/chip-screen. It is not likely
useful as is, but serves as an example of what can be done using
custom Lua scripts.
