  "  BGX is an Ethernet I/O Interface Block that supports 1 to 4 logical MACs
  (LMACs) with link speeds from 10 Mbps to 40 Gpbs.

    The BGX registers are partitioned into the follow sub-blocks:
    - BGX_CMR: Overall BGX configuration and common resources for all LMAC types
      (TX/RX buffers, statistics, etc.)
    - BGX_SMU: 10G+ MAC layer (40GBASE-R, 10GBASE-R, 10GBASE-X/XAUI, DXAUI,
      RXAUI)
    - BGX_SPU: 10G+ PCS layer
    - BGX_GMP: SGMII/1000BASE-X MAC layer (10/100/1000 Mbps) and
               SGMII/1000BASE-X PCS layer

    Overview of BGX_SPU registers
    =============================
    BGX_SPU has a register set per Logical PCS (LPCS), where each LPCS
    corresponds to a BGX_SMU LMAC. Each register set includes most of the O6x
    AGX PCSX registers, in addition to new registers to support features such as
    BASE-R, Forward Error Correction (FEC), and Clause 73 Auto-negotiation (AN).
    Most of the registers follow IEEE Std 802.3-2008/802.3ba-2010 Clause 45
    (MDIO) as summarized below.

          NUM_PCS_LANES specifies the number of of PCS lanes that are valid for
          each type. Each valid PCS lane is mapped to a physical serdes lane
          based on the programming of [LANE_TO_SDS].

          PCS Lane to Serdes Mapping.
          This is an array of 2-bit values that map each logical PCS Lane to a
          physical serdes lane, as follows:
            ----------+----------------------------------------------------------
            Bits     | Description                     Reset value
            ----------+----------------------------------------------------------
            <7:6>    | PCS Lane 3 Serdes ID            0x3
            <5:4>    | PCS Lane 2 Serdes ID            0x2
            <3:2>    | PCS Lane 1 Serdes ID            0x1
            <1:0>    | PCS Lane 0 Serdes ID            0x0
            ----------+----------------------------------------------------------

          PCS lanes 0 through NUM_PCS_LANES-1 are valid, where NUM_PCS_LANES is
          a function of the logical MAC/PCS type (see definition of
          LMAC_TYPE field in this register). For example, when LMAC_TYPE =
          RXAUI, then NUM_PCS_LANES = 2, PCS lanes 0 and 1 valid and the
          associated physical serdes lanes are selected by bits <1:0> and
          <3:2>, respectively.
          For 40GBASE-R (LMAC_TYPE = 40G_R), all four PCS lanes are valid, and
          the PCS lane IDs determine the block distribution order and
          associated alignment markers on the *transmit* side. This is not
          necessarily the order in which PCS lanes *receive* data because 802.3
          allows multi-lane BASE-R receive lanes to be re-ordered. When a
          lane (called 'service interface' in 802.3ba-2010) has achieved
          alignment marker lock on the receive side (i.e. the associated
          MARKER_LOCK bit is set in BR_ALGN_STATUS), then the actual detected
          RX PCS lane number is recorded in the corresponding LNx_MAPPING
          field in BR_LANE_MAP.

          Logical MAC ID that this DMAC CAM address applies to. BGX has 32 DMAC CAM entries that can
          be accessed with the BGX*_CMR_RX_ADR_CAM(0..31) CSRs. These 32 DMAC entries can be used by
          any of the four SGMII MACs or the 10G/40G MACs using these register bits.
          A typical configuration is to provide eight CAM entries per LMAC ID, which is configured
          using the following settings:
          LMAC interface 0: BGX(0..5)_CMR_RX_ADR(0..7)_CAM[ID] = 0x0
          LMAC interface 1: BGX(0..5)_CMR_RX_ADR(8..15)_CAM[ID] = 0x1

          802.3 diagrams 49-15 and 82-15, enters the RX_E state.
          Back-to-back blocks in the RX_E state are counted as transitions from RX_E to RX_E and
          keep incrementing the counter. The counter is reset to all 0s after this register is read
          by software.
          The reset operation takes precedence over the increment operation: if the register is read
          on the same clock cycle as an increment operation, the counter is reset to all 0s and the
          increment operation is lost.
          This field is writable for test purposes, rather than read-only as specified in Std 802.3.

      This register implements the Std 802.3 lane 0-3 mapping registers (3.400-3.403). It is valid
      only when the LPCS type is 40GBASE-R (BGXn_CMRm_CONFIG[LMAC_TYPE] = 0x4), and always returns
      0x0 for all other LPCS types. The LNx_MAPPING field for each programmed PCS lane (called
      service interface in 802.3ba-2010) is valid when that lane has achieved alignment marker lock
      on the receive side (i.e. the associated BGXn_SPUm_BR_ALGN_STATUS[MARKER_LOCK] = 1), and is
      invalid otherwise. When valid, it returns the actual detected receive PCS lane number based on
      the received alignment marker contents received on that service interface.
      The mapping is flexible because Std 802.3 allows multilane BASE-R receive lanes to be re-
      ordered. Note that for the transmit side, each PCS lane is mapped to a physical SerDes lane
      based on the programming of BGXn_CMRm_CONFIG[LANE_TO_SDS]. For the receive side,
      BGXn_CMRm_CONFIG[LANE_TO_SDS] specifies the service interface to physical SerDes lane mapping,
      and this register specifies the PCS lane to service interface mapping.

      TX logical PCS lane polarity vector [3:0] = XOR_TXPLRT[3:0] ^ {4{TXPLRT}}.
      In short, keep RXPLRT and TXPLRT cleared, and use XOR_RXPLRT and XOR_TXPLRT fields to define
      the polarity per logical PCS lane. Only bit 0 of vector is used for 10GBASE-R, and only bits

      "SKIP_AFTER_TERM field:
      SKIP_AFTER_TERM can be set to ensure sufficient density of XAUI
      Idle Skip (||R||) columns with a small transmit inter-frame gap (IFG) in
      order to allow the link partner's receiver to delete ||R|| columns as
      needed for clock rate compensation. It is usually set when the LMAC's
      transmit IFG is set to 8 bytes in HiGig/HiGig2 modes (i.e.
      BGX_SMU_TX_IFG[IFG1] + BGX_SMU_TX_IFG[IFG2] = 8), and should be cleared
      when the transmit IFG is greater than 8 bytes.

      When this bit is set, the SPU will send an ||R|| column after a
      ||T0|| column (terminate in lane 0) if no ||R|| was sent in the
      previous IFG. This is a minor deviation from the functionality
      specified in 802.3-2008 Figure 48-6 (PCS transmit source state
      diagram), whereby the state will transition directly from SEND_DATA
      to SEND_RANDOM_R after ||T0|| if no ||R|| was transmitted in the
      previous IFG. Sending ||R|| after ||T0|| only (and not ||T1||,
      ||T2|| or ||T3||) ensures that the check_end function at the
      receiving end, as defined in 802.3-2008 sub-clause 48.2.6.1.4, does
      not detect an error due to this functional change.

      When this bit is clear, the LMAC will fully conform to the
      functionality specified in Figure 48-6."

          groups of an RXAUI lane, i.e. interleave lanes before PCS layer as described in the Dune
          Networks/Broadcom RXAUI v2.1 specification. This obeys 6.25GHz serdes disparity.
          1 = Interleaved running disparity: Running disparity is computed separately for even and
          odd code-groups of an RXAUI lane, i.e. interleave lanes after PCS layer as described in
          the Marvell RXAUI Interface specification. This does not obey 6.25GHz SerDes disparity.

          40GBASE-R RX timestamp normalization disable. This bit controls the generation of the
          receive SOP timestamp passed to the SMU sub-block for a 40GBASE-R LMAC/LPCS. When this bit
          is clear, SPU normalizes the receive SOP timestamp in order to compensate for lane-to-lane
          skew on a 40GBASE-R link, as described below. When this bit is set, timestamp
          normalization is disabled and SPU directly passes the captured SOP timestamp values to
          SMU.
          In 40GBASE-R mode, a packet's SOP block can be transferred on any of the LMAC's lanes. In
          the presence of lane-to-lane skew, the SOP delay from transmit (by the link partner) to
          receive by SPU varies depending on which lane is used by the SOP block. This variation
          reduces the accuracy of the received SOP timestamp relative to when it was transmitted by
          the link partner.
          SPU captures the timestamp of the alignment marker received on each SerDes lane during
          align/skew detection; the captured value can be read from the SerDes lane's
          BGX(0..5)_SPU_SDS(0..3)_SKEW_STATUS[SKEW_STATUS] field (AM_TIMESTAMP sub-field). If
          alignment markers are transmitted at about the same time on all lanes by the link partner,
          then the difference between the AM_TIMESTAMP values for a pair of lanes represents the
          approximate skew between those lanes.
          SPU uses the 40GBASE-R LMAC's programmed PCS lane 0 as a reference and computes the
          AM_TIMESTAMP delta of every other lane relative to PCS lane 0. When normalization is
          enabled, SPU adjusts the timestamp of a received SOP by subtracting the receiving lane's
          AM_TIMESTAMP delta from the captured timestamp value. The adjusted/normalized timestamp
          value is then passed to SMU along with the SOP.
          Software can determine the actual maximum skew of a 40GBASE-R link by examining the
          AM_TIMESTAMP values in the BGX(0..5)_SPU_SDS(0..3)_SKEW_STATUS registers, and decide if
          timestamp normalization should be enabled or disabled to improve PTP accuracy.
          Normalization improves accuracy for larger skew values but reduces the accuracy (due to
          timestamp measurement errors) for small skew values.

          Enable link status checking by Auto-Negotiation arbitration state machine. When Auto-
          Negotiation is enabled (BGX(0..5)_SPU(0..3)_AN_CONTROL[AN_EN] is set), this bit controls
          the behavior of the Auto-Negotiation arbitration state machine when it reaches the AN GOOD
          CHECK state after DME pages are successfully exchanged, as defined in Figure 73-11 in
          802.3-2008.
          When this bit is set and the negotiated highest common denominator (HCD) technology
          matches BGX(0..5)_CMR(0..3)_CONFIG[LMAC_TYPE], the Auto-Negotiation arbitration SM
          performs the actions defined for the AN GOOD CHECK state in Figure 73-11, i.e. run the
          link_fail_inhibit timer and eventually transition to the AN GOOD or TRANSMIT DISABLE
          state.
          When this bit is clear or the HCD technology does not match LMAC_TYPE, the AN arbitration
          SM stay in the AN GOOD CHECK state, with the expectation that software will perform the
          appropriate actions to complete the Auto-Negotiation protocol, as follows:
          If this bit is clear and the HCD technology matches LMAC_TYPE, clear AN_EN in AN_CONTROL.
          Otherwise, disable the LPCS by clearing the BGX(0..5)_CMR(0..3)_CONFIG[ENABLE], clear
          BGX(0..5)_SPU(0..3)_AN_CONTROL[AN_EN], reconfigure the LPCS with the correct LMAC_TYPE,
          and re-enable the LPCS by setting BGX(0..5)_CMR(0..3)_CONFIG[ENABLE].
          In both cases, software should implement the link_fail_inhibit timer and verify the link
          status as specified for the AN GOOD CHECK state.

      This register controls the handling of the frames.
      The CTL_BCK/CTL_DRP bits control how the hardware handles incoming PAUSE packets. The most
      common modes of operation:
      CTL_BCK = 1, CTL_DRP = 1: hardware handles everything
      CTL_BCK = 0, CTL_DRP = 0: software sees all PAUSE frames
      CTL_BCK = 0, CTL_DRP = 1: all PAUSE frames are completely ignored
      These control bits should be set to CTL_BCK = 0,CTL_DRP = 0 in half-duplex mode. Since PAUSE
      packets only apply to full duplex operation, any PAUSE packet would constitute an exception
      which should be handled by the processing cores. PAUSE packets should not be forwarded.

      HiGig2 TX- and RX-enable are normally set together for HiGig2 messaging. Setting just the TX

      SGMII bit [12] is really a misnomer, it is a decode  of pi_qlm_cfg pins to indicate SGMII or
      1000Base-X modes.
      Note: MODE bit
      When MODE=1,  1000Base-X mode is selected. Auto negotiation will follow IEEE 802.3 clause 37.
      When MODE=0,  SGMII mode is selected and the following note will apply.
      Repeat note from SGM_AN_ADV register
      NOTE: The SGMII AN Advertisement Register above will be sent during Auto Negotiation if the
      MAC_PHY mode bit in misc_ctl_reg
      is set (1=PHY mode). If the bit is not set (0=MAC mode), the tx_config_reg[14] becomes ACK bit
      and [0] is always 1.
      All other bits in tx_config_reg sent will be 0. The PHY dictates the Auto Negotiation results.

      "Notes:
      (2) exception conditions 10:0 can also set the rcv/opcode in the received
      packet's workQ entry.  The BGX_GMP_GMI_RX_FRM_CHK register provides a bit mask
      for configuring which conditions set the error.
      (3) in half duplex operation, the expectation is that collisions will appear
      as either MINERR o r CAREXT errors.
      (4) JABBER An RX Jabber error indicates that a packet was received which
      is longer than the maximum allowed packet as defined by the
      system.  GMI will truncate the packet at the JABBER count.
      Failure to do so could lead to system instabilty.
      (5) NIBERR This error is illegal at 1000Mbs speeds
      (BGX_GMP_GMI_RX_PRT_CFG[SPEED]==0) and will never assert.
      (6) MAXERR for untagged frames, the total frame DA+SA+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS >
      BGX_GMP_GMI_RX_FRM_MAX.  For tagged frames, DA+SA+VLAN+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS
      > BGX_GMP_GMI_RX_FRM_MAX + 4*VLAN_VAL + 4*VLAN_STACKED.
      (7) MINERR total frame DA+SA+TL+DATA+PAD+FCS < 64
      (8) ALNERR Indicates that the packet received was not an integer number of
      bytes.  If FCS checking is enabled, ALNERR will only assert if
      the FCS is bad.  If FCS checking is disabled, ALNERR will
      assert in all non-integer frame cases.
      (9) Collisions Collisions can only occur in half-duplex mode.  A collision
      is assumed by the receiver when the slottime
      (BGX_GMP_GMI_PRT_CFG[SLOTTIME]) is not satisfied.  In 10/100 mode,
      this will result in a frame < SLOTTIME.  In 1000 mode, it
      could result either in frame < SLOTTIME or a carrier extend
      error with the SLOTTIME.  These conditions are visible by...
      . transfer ended before slottime COLDET
      . carrier extend error           CAREXT
      (A) LENERR Length errors occur when the received packet does not match the
      length field.  LENERR is only checked for packets between 64
      and 1500 bytes.  For untagged frames, the length must exact
      match.  For tagged frames the length or length+4 must match.
      (B) PCTERR checks that the frame begins with a valid PREAMBLE sequence.
      Does not check the number of PREAMBLE cycles.
      (C) OVRERR *DON'T PUT IN HRM*
      OVRERR is an architectural assertion check internal to GMI to
      make sure no assumption was violated.  In a correctly operating
      system, this interrupt can never fire.
      GMI has an internal arbiter which selects which of 4 ports to
      buffer in the main RX FIFO.  If we normally buffer 8 bytes,
      then each port will typically push a tick every 8 cycles if
      the packet interface is going as fast as possible.  If there
      are four ports, they push every two cycles.  So that's the
      assumption.  That the inbound module will always be able to
      consume the tick before another is produced.  If that doesn't
      happen that's when OVRERR will assert."

      PRE_STRP
      When PRE_CHK is set (indicating that the PREAMBLE will be sent), PRE_STRP
      determines if the PREAMBLE+SFD bytes are thrown away or sent to the Octane
      core as part of the packet.
      In either mode, the PREAMBLE+SFD bytes are not counted toward the packet
      size when checking against the MIN and MAX bounds.  Furthermore, the bytes
      are skipped when locating the start of the L2 header for DMAC and Control
      frame recognition.
      CTL_BCK/CTL_DRP
      These bits control how the HW handles incoming PAUSE packets.  Here are
      the most common modes of operation:
      CTL_BCK=1,CTL_DRP=1   - HW does it all
      CTL_BCK=0,CTL_DRP=0   - SW sees all pause frames
      CTL_BCK=0,CTL_DRP=1   - all pause frames are completely ignored
      These control bits should be set to CTL_BCK=0,CTL_DRP=0 in halfdup mode.
      Since PAUSE packets only apply to fulldup operation, any PAUSE packet
      would constitute an exception which should be handled by the processing
      cores.  PAUSE packets should not be forwarded.

      Notes:
      Choosing proper values of BGX_GMP_GMI_TX_PAUSE_PKT_TIME[TIME] and
      BGX_GMP_GMI_TX_PAUSE_PKT_INTERVAL[INTERVAL] can be challenging to the system
      designer.  It is suggested that TIME be much greater than INTERVAL and
      BGX_GMP_GMI_TX_PAUSE_ZERO[SEND] be set.  This allows a periodic refresh of the PAUSE
      count and then when the backpressure condition is lifted, a PAUSE packet
      with TIME==0 will be sent indicating that Octane is ready for additional
      data.
      If the system chooses to not set BGX_GMP_GMI_TX_PAUSE_ZERO[SEND], then it is
      suggested that TIME and INTERVAL are programmed such that they satisify the
      following rule...
      INTERVAL <= TIME - (largest_pkt_size + IFG + pause_pkt_size)
      where largest_pkt_size is that largest packet that the system can send
      (normally 1518B), IFG is the interframe gap and pause_pkt_size is the size
      of the PAUSE packet (normally 64B).
