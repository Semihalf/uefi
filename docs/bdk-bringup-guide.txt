Board Validation with the Bringup and Diagnostic Kit
====================================================

Overview
--------

This document is a step by step procedure for verifying proper
hardware functionality of boards based on OCTEON processors.  The
target audience is either board designers or validation engineers
charged with the task of verifying hardware. By following this guide,
the following goals should be met.

.Final Goals
* The OCTEON processor booted and running software.
* All packet interfaces verified as operational.
* Miscellaneous I/O busses verified as operational, such as TWSI and SMI/MDIO.
* If applicable, PCIe as a root complex verified as operational.
* DRAM configured and tested.
* Board ready to be handed to software for further development.

.Board Block Diagram

Below is a high level block diagram for a generic board.  The board
being tested will have connections similar to the diagram.

Step 1 - Minimum Prerequisites
------------------------------

Certain minimum requirements must be met before progress can continue.
OCTEON must progress through the reset sequence documented in the
hardware manual. OCTEON's UART0 must be connected to a serial terminal
in order to monitor the boot progress.

* OCTEON reference clock must be at 50 Mhz.
* OCTEON reset sequence must follow the hardware reference manual.
* UART0 connected to a serial terminal. Baud rate of 115200, no parity, one stop bit.
* If booting from flash, a NOR flash must be connected to OCTEON's bootbus.

Step 2 - Boot the BDK
---------------------

Burn bdk-full.bin to NOR flash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a flash programmer to burn the image *bdk-full.bin* to the
beginning of the NOR flash.  The first byte of *bdk-full.bin* should
be at address zero, the second at address one, etc.

Boot over PCIe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target board must be connected as a PCIe endpoint to a PC system
running Linux.

. Apply any additional power need for the target board.
. Boot the PCIe host PC into Linux.
. Install the BDK on the PC by following the instructions in link:bdk.html[BDK documentation].
. Issue the following shell commands.

[source, sh]
----
$ export OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL=pci
$ bdk-remote boot target-bin/bdk-full.bin
----

Boot over EJTAG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The BDK has been tested with multiple EJTAG probes.  The best
supported probe is the Macraigor mpDemon, followed by the Mentor
Graphics Majic.  The following sections details the process of booting
the BDK using either probe.  Other EJTAG probes should be similar.

include::sections/bdk-ejtag-mentor-majic.txt[]

Successful Booting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If everything went well, the following output should be visible in the
serial terminal.  If booting did not succeed, re-check step 1.

Step 8 - Test the RGMII/MII Management Ports

Step 9 - Test SGMII

Step 10 - Test XAUI
-------------------

Step 11 - Test Interlaken
-------------------------

Step 12 - Configure and Test DDR
--------------------------------

Step 13 - Test NAND
-------------------

TBD


Step 14 - Test USB
------------------

TBD


Step 15 - Test GPIO
-------------------

Many boards use OCTEON GPIOs to control other parts of the board.  The
GPIO menu can be used to manually control the GPIO pins.

.The GPIO Menu
----
include::captures/gpio_menu.capture[]
----

Configure a GPIO::

Choose this option to configure a GPIO.  Prompts ask for which GPIO
and its input or output state.  Here is an example configuring GPIO 0
as a high output.
+
----
GPIO number(29INS)> 0
Configure as output(y/n)(30INS)> y
GPIO state (0/1)(31INS)> 1
----

Read GPIO state::

Read the current state of a GPIO.
+
----
GPIO number(1INS)> 0
GPIO 0: 1
----


Next Steps
----------

After completing the test steps outlined in this document, most board
I/O interfaces have been validated.  With working DDR3 and validated
I/Os, software development can start on the board.  Software should
burn the normal bootloader into NOR flash, overwriting the BDK.  This
can be done either using a flash programmer, or the flash menu in the
BDK.

.The Flash Menu
----
include::captures/flash_menu.capture[]
----

View flash::

Dumps the contents of flash in a hexadecimal dump.

Write flash::

Allows writing a file directly to flash.  Refer to the general BDK
documentation for information about files.

TIP: During the software development process it can be useful to have
known good binaries that exercise the board.  Keep the BDK around as
it makes a good test bench.  One board running the BDK can be used to
help debug software running on another board.
