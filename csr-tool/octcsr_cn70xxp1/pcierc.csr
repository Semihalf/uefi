          This register can be used for either of the following purposes:
          o To send a specific PCI Express Message, the application
          writes the payload of the Message into this register, then
          sets bit 0 of the Port Link Control Register to send the
          Message.
          o To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all
          TLPs, the application places a 32-bit corruption pattern into
          this register and enables this function by setting bit 25 of
          the Port Link Control Register. When enabled, the transmit
          LCRC result is XOR'd with this pattern before inserting
          it into the packet.

          N_FTS
          Sets the Number of Fast Training Sequences (N_FTS) that
          the core advertises as its N_FTS during GEN2 Link training.
          This value is used to inform the Link partner about the PHYs
          ability to recover synchronization after a low power state.
          Note: Do not set N_FTS to zero; doing so can cause the
          LTSSM to go into the recovery state when exiting from
          L0s.
