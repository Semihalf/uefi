          LIP Input Skid FIFO dropped a beat because it was full. This only happens if LAP issues
          request beats but has no ase__lap1_credit<0>s to do so; this indicates LAP credits are
          misprogrammed. If this interrupt fires, the software has to reset LAP1 and ASE to recover,
          as the credits are out of sync.

    description: |
      This register contains the interrupt status for ECC failures. In all cases below, except
      LUE_KDT_*, any request that generates an error has its response marked as errored. The
      LUE_KDT_DBE error is not indicated in the response packet; the only indication of this error
      is the interrupt mechanism.
      For all the LUE* errors below, additional information can be obtained by reading the
      ASE_LUE_ERROR_LOG. For all the LIP*/LOP* errors below, additional information can be obtained
      by reading ASE_LUF_ERROR_LOG.
    internal: |
      INTERNAL: Because ECC will tag associated responses as errored, most of these interrupts are
      for diagnostic use, not for error handling.

      bit when the request is sent. If another VALID=1 is written before the bit is cleared, it will
      not trigger another SOP. Software should take care to wait for the response before issuing
      another request. Hardware deasserts ASE_BACKDOOR_RSP_CTL[VALID] when VALID is triggered.

      Information is only logged to this register if the bit corresponding to the ERROR_ID is set in

      ASE_*_INT[LUE*] are cleared, or an error occurs that is of higher-priority than the error for
      which information is currently logged by this CSR.
      The priority of the error is encoded by the enumerated values in ASE_LUE_ERROR_ID_E. The
      highest priority error is KDT_DBE, the lowest is RFT_SBE. For RFT errors, if multiple errors
