          may only be changed when EN was previously clear, though it may be changed with the same
          write that sets EN. Thus if EN is set, to change IDT two register writes are required, the
          first to clear EN (perhaps by a store to CIU_ISC(0..1048575)_W1C), and the second to make
          the change to IDT.
