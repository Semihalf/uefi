          stack structures is disabled. In this mode, the linked-list chunk boundary checking is not
          done, and therefore the previous/next pointers are non-existent. The stacks are
          effectively in an infinite linear buffer, bounded only by the maximum sizes provided in

          HPUs/cluster), if HPU_CLCRIP=0x1, then HPU #s [9] within the cluster are crippled and only
          HPU#s [8:0] are available.
          IMPNOTE: The encodings are done in such a way as to later be used with fuses (for future
          revisions which will disable some number of HPUs). Blowing a fuse has the effect that
          there will always be fewer HPUs available. [i.e: we never want a customer to blow
          additional fuses to get more HPUs].

          maps to upper 127.75GB of DDR3 SDRAM
          NOTE: the 2nd 256MB HOLE maps to IO and is unused(nonexistent) for memory.

          In the event the HNA generates a reference to the L2/DRAM
          address hole (0x0000.0FFF.FFFF - 0x0000.1FFF.FFFF) the HNANXM

          NOTE: If HNANXM is set during a HNA Graph Walk operation,
          then the walk will prematurely terminate with RWORD0[REAS]=MEMERR.
