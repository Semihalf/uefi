    description: |
      Selects which group(s) a PP belongs to.  A '1' in any bit position sets the PP's membership in
      the corresponding group.  A value of 0x0 will prevent the PP from receiving new work.  Note:
      disabled or non-existent PP's should have this field set to 0xffff (the reset value) in order
      to
      maximize POW performance.
      Also contains the QOS level priorities for each PP.  0x0 is highest priority, and 0x7 the
      lowest.
      Setting the priority to 0xf will prevent that PP from receiving work from that QOS level.
      Priority values 0x8 through 0xe are reserved and should not be used.  For a given PP,
      priorities
      should begin at 0x0 and remain contiguous throughout the range.

      Contains the thresholds for enabling and setting work queue interrupts.  For more information
      regarding this register, see the interrupt section.
      Note: Up to 4 of the POW's internal storage buffers can be allocated for hardware use and are
      therefore not available for incoming work queue entries.  Additionally, any PP that is not in
      the
      NULL_NULL state consumes a buffer.  Thus in a 4 PP system, it is not advisable to set either
      IQ_THR or DS_THR to greater than 512 - 4 - 4 = 504.  Doing so may prevent the interrupt from
      ever triggering.

  - name: POW_NW_TIM
    title: POW New Work Timer Period Register
    address: 0x1670000000210
    bus: NCB
    description: |
      Sets the minimum period for a new work request timeout.  Period is specified in n-1 notation
      where the increment value is 1024 clock cycles.  Thus, a value of 0x0 in this register
      translates
      to 1024 cycles, 0x1 translates to 2048 cycles, 0x2 translates to 3072 cycles, etc...  Note:
      the
      maximum period for a new work request timeout is 2 times the minimum period.  Note: the new
      work
      request timeout counter is reset when this register is written.
      There are two new work request timeout cases:
      - WAIT bit clear.  The new work request can timeout if the timer expires before the pre-fetch
      engine has reached the end of all work queues.  This can occur if the executable work queue
      entry is deep in the queue and the pre-fetch engine is subject to many resets (i.e. high
      switch,
      de-schedule, or new work load from other PP's).  Thus, it is possible for a PP to receive a
      work
      response with the NO_WORK bit set even though there was at least one executable entry in the
      work queues.  The other (and typical) scenario for receiving a NO_WORK response with the WAIT
      bit clear is that the pre-fetch engine has reached the end of all work queues without finding
      executable work.
      - WAIT bit set.  The new work request can timeout if the timer expires before the pre-fetch
      engine has found executable work.  In this case, the only scenario where the PP will receive a
      work response with the NO_WORK bit set is if the timer expires.  Note: it is still possible
      for
      a PP to receive a NO_WORK response even though there was at least one executable entry in the
      work queues.
      In either case, it's important to note that switches and de-schedules are higher priority
      operations that can cause the pre-fetch engine to reset.  Thus in a system with many switches
      or
      de-schedules occuring, it's possible for the new work timer to expire (resulting in NO_WORK
      responses) before the pre-fetch engine is able to get very deep into the work queues.

      Also contains the remote pointer error bit and interrupt enable.  RPE is set when the POW
      detected
      corruption on one or more of the input queue lists in L2/DRAM (POW's local copy of the tail
      pointer
      for the L2/DRAM input queue did not match the last entry on the the list).   This is caused by
      L2/DRAM corruption, and is generally a fatal error because it likely caused POW to load bad

      queue entries.
