    description: |
      This register allows software to:
      Initiate master-mode operations with a write operation, and read the result with a
      read operation.
      Load four bytes for later retrieval (slave mode) with a write operation and check validity
      with a read operation.
      Launch a configuration read/write operation with a write operation and read the result with a
      read operation.
      This register should be read or written by software, and read by the TWSI device. The TWSI
      device can use either two-byte or five-byte read operations to reference this register.
      The TWSI device considers this register valid when [V] = 1 and [SLONLY] = 1.

          Valid bit:

          cleared when a TWSI master-mode operation completes
          cleared when a TWSI configuration register access completes

          When this bit is set, no operations are initiated with a write operation. Only the D field
          is updated in this case
          When this bit is clear, a write operation initiates either a master-mode operation or a
          TWSI configuration register access.
