SF (SPI Flash) command
----------------------
sf UEFI command is used to write/read/erase SPI flash memory.

Syntax
------
sf [help] [probe] [read] [write] [erase] [update] [-d] [-a <Address>]
[-o <Offset>] [-l <Length>]

Usage
-----
On of the read/write/erase modes must be specified. Erase requires only Offset
and Length, but read, write and update requires Offset, Length and Address.
probe  - check response from SPI flash by reading its ID
read   - read from SPI flash Offset into RAM Address
write  - write data from RAM Address into SPI flash at Offset
erase  - erase data in SPI flash at Offset (must be 0x10000 aligned)
update - update data from RAM Address into SPI flash at Offset
-d     - dump memory read from SPI flash, only with read mode
help   - show help massage
Address - address in RAM of data to be copied/stored (in hex)
Offset  - offset in SPI flash to read/write (in hex)
Length  - number of bytes to read/write/erase (in hex or dec)

Examples
--------
Check if there is response from SPI flash
  sf probe
Read 32 bytes from 0xe00000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x100000
  sf read -a 0x100000 -o 0xe00000 -l 32
Read 0x20 bytes from 0x200000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x300000 and print output
  sf read -a 0x300000 -o 0x200000 -l 0x20 -d
Erase 0x10000 bytes from offset 0x100000 of SPI flash
  sf erase -o 0x100000 -l 0x100000
Write 16 bytes from 0x200000 at RAM into SPI flash at address 0x4000000
  sf write -a 0x200000 -o 0x4000000 -l 16
Update 100 bytes from 0x100000 at RAM in SPI flash at address 0xe00000
  sf update -a 0x100000 -o 0xe00000 -l 100
