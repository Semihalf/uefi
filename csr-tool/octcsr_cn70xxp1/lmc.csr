  - name: LMC(0..0)_FADR
    title: LMC Failing Address Register (SEC/DED/NXM)
    address: 0x1180088000020 | a<<24
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      This register only captures the first transaction with ECC errors. A DED error can over-write
      this register with its failing addresses if the first error was a SEC. If you write
      LMC(0..0)_INT -> SEC_ERR/DED_ERR, it clears the error bits and captures the next failing
      address. If FDIMM is 1, that means the error is in the high DIMM.
      LMC(0..0)_FADR captures the failing pre-scrambled address location (split into DIMM, bunk,
      bank, etc). If scrambling is off, then LMC(0..0)_FADR will also capture the failing physical
      location in the DRAM parts. LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR captures the actual failing address
      location in the physical DRAM parts, i.e.,
      If scrambling is on, LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR contains the failing physical location in the
      DRAM parts (split into DIMM, bunk, bank, etc.)
      If scrambling is off, the pre-scramble and post-scramble addresses are the same; and so the
      contents of LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR match the contents of LMC(0..0)_FADR.

      This register captures only the first transaction with a NXM error while an interrupt is

      LMC(0..0)_INT[NXM_ERR]. It captures the actual L2C-LMC address provided to the LMC that caused
      the NXM error. A read or write NXM error is captured only if enabled using the NXM event
      enables.

          If there are two consecutive power-up/init's without
          a DRESET assertion between them, LMC asserts DDR_DIMM*_CKE as part of
          the first power-up/init, and continues to assert DDR_DIMM*_CKE
          through the remainder of the first and the second power-up/init.
          If DDR_DIMM*_CKE deactivation and reactivation is needed for
          a second power-up/init, a DRESET assertion is required
          between the first and the second."

      Therefore, row = mem_adr[29:16] and mem_msb = 4.
      Note also that addresses greater than the max defined space (pbank_msb) are also treated as
      NXM accesses.

          Chip select mask. This mask corresponds to the four chip selects for a memory
          configuration. If LMC(0..0)_CONFIG[RANK_ENA]=0 then this mask must be set in pairs because
          each reference address will assert a pair of chip selects. If the chip select(s) have a
          corresponding CS_MASK bit set, then the reference is to nonexistent memory (NXM). LMC will
          alias a NXM read reference to use the lowest, legal chip select(s) and return zeros. LMC
          normally discards NXM write operations, but will also alias them when LMC(0..0)_CONTROL
          [NXM_WRITE_EN]=1.

    title: LMC Write OnDieTermination Mask Register
    address: 0x11800880001B0 | a<<24
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      System designers may desire to terminate DQ/DQS lines for higher-frequency DDR operations,
      especially on a multirank system. DDR3 DQ/DQS I/Os have built-in termination resistors that
      can be turned on or off by the controller, after meeting TAOND and TAOF timing requirements.
      Each rank has its own ODT pin that fans out to all of the memory parts in that DIMM. System
      designers may prefer different combinations of ODT ONs for write operations into different
      ranks. CN78XX supports full programmability by way of the mask register below. Each rank
      position has its own 4-bit programmable field. When the controller does a write to that rank,
      it sets the 4 ODT pins to the mask pins below. For example, when doing a write into Rank0, a
      system designer may desire to terminate the lines with the resistor on DIMM0/Rank1. The mask
      WODT_D0_R0 would then be {0010}.
      CN78XX drives the appropriate mask values on the ODT pins by default. If this feature is not
      required, write 0x0 in this register. When a given RANK is selected, the WODT mask for that
      RANK is used. The resulting WODT mask is driven to the DIMMs in the following manner:
    internal: |
      When a given RANK is selected, the WODT mask for that RANK is used.  The resulting WODT mask
      is
      driven to the DIMMs in the following manner:
      RANK_ENA=1                    RANK_ENA=0
      Mask[3] -> DIMM1_ODT_1                     MBZ
      Mask[2] -> DIMM1_ODT_0                     DIMM1_ODT_0
      Mask[1] -> DIMM0_ODT_1                     MBZ
      Mask[0] -> DIMM0_ODT_0                     DIMM0_ODT_0
      LMC always writes entire cache blocks and always writes them via two consecutive
      write CAS operations to the same rank+bank+row spaced exactly 4 CK's apart.
      When a WODT mask bit is set, LMC asserts the OCTEON ODT output
      pin(s) starting the same CK as the first write CAS operation. Then, OCTEON
      normally continues to assert the ODT output pin(s) for 9+LMC*_CONTROL[WODT_BPRCH] more CK's
      for a total of 10+LMC*_CONTROL[WODT_BPRCH] CK's for the entire cache block write -
      through the second write CAS operation of the cache block,
      satisfying the 6 CK DDR3 ODTH8 requirements.
      But it is possible for OCTEON to issue two cache block writes separated by as few as
      WtW = 8 or 9 (10 if LMC*_CONTROL[WODT_BPRCH]=1) CK's. In that case, OCTEON asserts the ODT
      output pin(s)
      for the WODT mask of the first cache block write for WtW CK's, then asserts
      the ODT output pin(s) for the WODT mask of the second cache block write for
      10+LMC*_CONTROL[WODT_BPRCH] CK's
      (or less if a third cache block write follows within 8 or 9 (or 10) CK's of this second cache
      block write).
      Note that it may be necessary to force LMC to space back-to-back cache block writes
      to different ranks apart by at least 10+LMC*_CONTROL[WODT_BPRCH] CK's to prevent DDR3 ODTH8
      violations.

      This register controls the DDR_CK frequency. For details, refer to CK Speed Programming. See
      LMC Initialization Sequence for the initialization sequence.
      DDR PLL Bringup sequence:
      1. Write CLKF, DDR_PS_EN, DFM_PS_EN, DIFFAMP, CPS, CPB. If test mode is going to be activated,
      then also write jtg__ddr_pll_tm_en1, jtg__ddr_pll_tm_en2, jtg__ddr_pll_tm_en3,
      jtg__ddr_pll_tm_en4, jtg__dfa_pll_tm_en1, jtg__dfa_pll_tm_en2, jtg__dfa_pll_tm_en3,
      jtg__dfa_pll_tm_en4, JTAG_TEST_MODE
      2. Wait 128 ref clock cycles (7680 rclk cycles)
      3. Write 1 to RESET_N
      4. Wait 1152 ref clocks (1152*16 rclk cycles)
      5. Write 0 to DDR_DIV_RESET and DFM_DIV_RESET
      6. Wait 10 ref clock cycles (160 rclk cycles) before bringing up the DDR interface
      If test mode is going to be activated, wait an additional 8191 ref clocks (8191*16 rclk+
      cycles) to allow PLL clock alignment.

          well as FCLK & REFCLK can only be performed after the ddr_pll_divider_reset is deasserted.
          SW need to wait at least 10 reference clock cycles after deasserting pll_divider_reset
          before asserting LMC(0..0)_DDR_PLL_CTL[JTG_TEST_MODE]. During alignment (which can take up
          to 160 microseconds) DCLK and FCLK can exhibit some high-frequency pulses. Therefore, all
          bring up activities in that clock domain need to be delayed (when the chip operates in
          jtg_test_mode) by about 160 microseconds to ensure that lock is achieved.

    title: LMC Read OnDieTermination Mask Register
    address: 0x1180088000268 | a<<24
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      System designers may desire to terminate DQ/DQS lines for higher frequency DDR operations,
      especially on a multirank system. DDR3 DQ/DQS I/Os have built-in termination resistors that
      can be turned on or off by the controller, after meeting TAOND and TAOF timing requirements.
      Each rank has its own ODT pin that fans out to all the memory parts in that DIMM. System
      designers may prefer different combinations of ODT ONs for read operations into different
      ranks. CN78XX supports full programmability by way of the mask register below. Each rank
      position has its own 4-bit programmable field. When the controller does a read to that rank,
      it sets the 4 ODT pins to the MASK pins below. For example, when doing a read from Rank0, a
      system designer may desire to terminate the lines with the resistor on DIMM0/Rank1. The mask
      RODT_D0_R0 would then be {0010}.
      CN78XX drives the appropriate mask values on the ODT pins by default. If this feature is not
      required, write 0x0 in this register. Note that, as per the JEDEC DDR3 specifications, the ODT
      pin for the rank that is being read should always be 0x0.
      When a given RANK is selected, the RODT mask for that rank is used. The resulting RODT mask is
      driven to the DIMMs in the following manner:
      RANK_ENA=1                    RANK_ENA=0
      Mask[3] -> DIMM1_ODT_1                    MBZ
      Mask[2] -> DIMM1_ODT_0                          DIMM1_ODT_0
      Mask[1] -> DIMM0_ODT_1                    MBZ
      Mask[0] -> DIMM0_ODT_0                    DIMM0_ODT_0
      LMC always reads entire cache blocks and always reads them via two consecutive
      read CAS operations to the same rank+bank+row spaced exactly 4 CK's apart.
      When a RODT mask bit is set, LMC asserts the OCTEON ODT output
      pin(s) starting (CL CWL) CK's after the first read CAS operation. Then, OCTEON
      normally continues to assert the ODT output pin(s) for 9+LMC*_CONTROL[RODT_BPRCH] more CK's
      for a total of 10+LMC*_CONTROL[RODT_BPRCH] CK's for the entire cache block read -
      through the second read CAS operation of the cache block,
      satisfying the 6 CK DDR3 ODTH8 requirements.
      But it is possible for OCTEON to issue two cache block reads separated by as few as
      RtR = 8 or 9 (10 if LMC*_CONTROL[RODT_BPRCH]=1) CK's. In that case, OCTEON asserts the ODT
      output pin(s)
      for the RODT mask of the first cache block read for RtR CK's, then asserts
      the ODT output pin(s) for the RODT mask of the second cache block read for
      10+LMC*_CONTROL[RODT_BPRCH] CK's
      (or less if a third cache block read follows within 8 or 9 (or 10) CK's of this second cache
      block read).
      Note that it may be necessary to force LMC to space back-to-back cache block reads
      to different ranks apart by at least 10+LMC*_CONTROL[RODT_BPRCH] CK's to prevent DDR3 ODTH8
      violations.

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      Four of these CSRs exist per LMC, one for each rank. Deskew setting is measured in units of
      1/2 CK, so the BYTEn values can range over 16 CK cycles. Each CSR is written by hardware
      during a read-leveling sequence for the rank. (Hardware sets STATUS to 3 after hardware read-
      leveling completes for the rank.)
      If hardware is unable to find a match per LMC(0..0)_RLEVEL_CTL[OFFSET_EN] and
      LMC(0..0)_RLEVEL_CTL[OFFSET], then hardware sets LMC(0..0)_RLEVEL_RANK(0..3)[BYTEn<5:0>] to
      0x0.
      Each CSR may also be written by software, but not while a read-leveling sequence is in
      progress. (Hardware sets STATUS to 1 after a CSR write.) Software initiates a hardware read-
      leveling sequence by programming LMC(0..0)_RLEVEL_CTL and writing INIT_START = 1 with
      SEQ_SEL=1. See LMC*_RLEVEL_CTL.
      LMC*_RLEVEL_RANKi values for ranks i without attached DRAM should be set such that they do not
      increase the range of possible BYTE values for any byte lane. The easiest way to do this is to
      set LMC*_RLEVEL_RANKi = LMC*_RLEVEL_RANKj, where j is some rank with attached DRAM whose
      LMC*_RLEVEL_RANKj is already fully initialized.

      these pass/fail results for a different rank, you must run the hardware read-leveling again.

    bus: RSL
    description: |
      Four of these CSRs exist per LMC, one for each rank. Deskew setting is measured in units of
      1/8 CK, so the below BYTEn values can range over 4 CK cycles. Assuming
      LMC(0..0)_WLEVEL_CTL[SSET]=0, the BYTEn<2:0> values are not used during write-leveling, and
      they are overwritten by the hardware as part of the write-leveling sequence. (Hardware sets
      STATUS to 3 after hardware write-leveling completes for the rank). Software needs to set
      BYTEn<4:3> bits.
      Each CSR may also be written by software, but not while a write-leveling sequence is in
      progress. (Hardware sets STATUS to 1 after a CSR write.) Software initiates a hardware write-
      leveling sequence by programming LMC*_WLEVEL_CTL and writing RANKMASK and INIT_START=1 with
      SEQ_SEL=6 in LMC*0_CONFIG.
      LMC will then step through and accumulate write leveling results for 8 unique delay settings
      (twice), starting at a delay of LMC(0..0)_WLEVEL_RANK(0..3) [BYTEn<4:3>]* 8 CK increasing by
      1/8 CK each setting. Hardware will then set LMC(0..0)_WLEVEL_RANK(0..3)[BYTEn<2:0>] to
      indicate the first write leveling result of '1' that followed a result of '0' during the
      sequence by searching for a '1100' pattern in the generated bitmask, except that LMC will
      always write LMC(0..0)_WLEVEL_RANK(0..3)[BYTEn<0>]=0. If hardware is unable to find a match
      for a '1100' pattern, then hardware sets LMC(0..0)_WLEVEL_RANK(0..3) [BYTEn<2:0>] to 0x4. See
      LMC*_WLEVEL_CTL.
      LMC*_WLEVEL_RANKi values for ranks i without attached DRAM should be set such that they do not
      increase the range of possible BYTE values for any byte lane. The easiest way to do this is to
      set LMC*_WLEVEL_RANKi = LMC*_WLEVEL_RANKj, where j is some rank with attached DRAM whose
      LMC*_WLEVEL_RANKj is already fully initialized.

    title: LMC Scrambled Failing Address Register (SEC/DED/NXM)
    address: 0x1180088000330 | a<<24
    bus: RSL
    description: |
      LMC(0..0)_FADR captures the failing pre-scrambled address location (split into DIMM, bunk,
      bank, etc). If scrambling is off, LMC(0..0)_FADR also captures the failing physical location
      in the DRAM parts. LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR captures the actual failing address location in
      the physical DRAM parts, i.e.:
      If scrambling is on, LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR contains the failing physical location in the
      DRAM parts (split into DIMM, bunk, bank, etc);
      If scrambling is off, the pre-scramble and post-scramble addresses are the same, and so the
      contents of LMC(0..0)_SCRAMBLED_FADR match the contents of LMC(0..0)_FADR.
      This register only captures the first transaction with ECC errors. A DED error can over-write
      this register with its failing addresses if the first error was a SEC. If you write
      LMC(0..0)_CONFIG -> SEC_ERR/DED_ERR, it clears the error bits and captures the next failing
      address. If FDIMM is 1, that means the error is in the higher DIMM.

          Failing column address <13:0>. Technically, represents the address of the 128b data that
          had an ECC error, i.e., FCOL<0> is always 0. Can be used in conjunction with
          LMC(0..0)_CONFIG[DED_ERR] to isolate the 64b chunk of data in error.
