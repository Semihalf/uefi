      NOTE:
      Whenever AN_EN bit[12] is set, Auto negotiation is allowed to happen. The results
      of the auto negotiation process set the fields in the AN_RESULTS reg. When AN_EN is not set,
      AN_RESULTS reg is don't care. The effective SPD, DUP etc.. get their values
      from the pcs_mr_ctrl reg.

      PCS Logic Analyzer Register
      NOTE: Logic Analyzer is enabled with LA_EN for the specified PCS lane only. PKT_SZ is
      effective only when LA_EN=1
      For normal operation(sgmii or 1000Base-X), this bit must be 0.
      See pcsx.csr for xaui logic analyzer mode.

          Some clock ratios may require a larger setting of 20.
          Value of zero will disable TX packet flow on the port
