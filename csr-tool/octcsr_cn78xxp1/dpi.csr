          DMA engine commit mode.

          generates the final write for the current instruction.
          When COMMIT_MODE=1, DPI additionally waits for the final write to reach the interface
          coherency point to declare the instructions complete.
          Please note: when COMMIT_MODE == 0, DPI may not follow the HRM ordering rules. DPI
          hardware performance may be better with COMMIT_MODE == 0 than with COMMIT_MODE == 1 due to
          the relaxed ordering rules. If the HRM ordering rules are required, set COMMIT_MODE == 1.

          QUE captures the ErrorResponse status of the last 6 instructions for each instruction
          queue. STATUS<5> represents the status for first instruction in instruction order while
          STATUS<0> represents the last or most recent instruction. If STATUS<n> is set, then the
          nth instruction in the given queue experienced an ErrorResponse. Otherwise, it completed
          normally.

          DPI DMA per-core instruction completion counter. The counter is incremented according to
          conditions described below and is decremented by values written to this field. A CNT of
          nonzero causes an interrupt in DPI_DMA_PP_INT.
          Each DMA instruction that has the DPI_DMA_INSTR_HDR_S[PT]==CNT and a PTR value of 1 to
          0x30 will increment DPI_DMA_PP(0..47)_CNT value -1 counter. Hardware reserves the values
          0x31 to 0x3F for future use, treats them as a PTR of 0, and does nothing.
