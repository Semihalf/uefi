          o To send a specific PCI Express Message, the application
          writes the payload of the Message into this register, then
          sets bit 0 of the Port Link Control Register to send the
          Message.
          o To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all
          TLPs, the application places a 32-bit corruption pattern into
          this register and enables this function by setting bit 25 of
          the Port Link Control Register. When enabled, the transmit
          LCRC result is XOR'd with this pattern before inserting
          it into the packet.

          Loopback Enable
          Initiate loopback mode as a master. On a 0->1 transition,
          the PCIe core sends TS ordered sets with the loopback bit set
          to cause the link partner to enter into loopback mode as a
          slave. Normal transmission is not possible when LE=1. To exit
          loopback mode, take the link through a reset sequence.
