  The USBDRD controller implements three kinds of CSRs:
    * UCTL RSL-type registers: 2KB starting at address    0x1_1800_6800_0000
    * UAHC NCB-type registers: 1MB starting at address    0x1_6800_0000_0000
    * UPHY indirect registers: indirect access via the UCTL_PORT*_CR_DBG_*
      registers. (See Synopsys PHY databook for details)
  Note: These address examples are for instance 0.

  == UCTL ==================================================

  UCTL registers are only accessible via RSL. They generally contain basic
  clock controls, resets, and static configuration bits for the entire USB
  subsystem.

  Note that UCTL registers starting from 0x30 can be accessed only
  after HCLK is enabled and UCTL_RST is deasserted.

  Undefined offsets in the UCTL register region will return
  64'hFFFFFFFF_FFFFFFFF on reads, writes will have no side-effects.
  No addresses should alias.

  The UCTL registers are big-endian.

  == UAHC =================================================

  UAHC registers are implemented by the Host Controller,
  access is provided to these registers over RSL or NCB. The only registers
  that may require the high-performance NCB path are the XHCI Runtime registers.

  Access to the UAHC registers follows the same rules as registers 0x30 to 0xF8
  of the UCTL. In other words, HCLK must be enabled, UCTL_RST must be deasserted.

  The UAHC registers require 1MB of address space. The interior mapping is:
    Offset                Register Type
    0x0_0000 - 0x0_7FFF   XHCI Registers (X* prefix)
      0x0000 - 0x001f       XHCI Capability Registers
      0x0020 - 0x005f       Operational Registers
      0x0420 - 0x043f       Port Registers
      0x0440 - 0x0443       Runtime Registers
      0x0460 - 0x047f       Interrupt Registers
      0x0480 - 0x0583       Doorbell Registers
      0x0880 - 0x08af       XHCI Extended Capabilities
    0x0_C100 - 0x0_C6FF   Global Registers (G* prefix)
    0x4_0000 - 0x7_FFFF   Internal RAM 0 Debug Access
    0x8_0000 - 0xB_FFFF   Internal RAM 1 Debug Access
    0xC_0000 - 0xF_FFFF   Internal RAM 2 Debug Access

  For more information about the "XHCI Registers", see the XHCI specification.

  6.1.3 and 6.2.
  INTERNAL: For more on XHCI registers, see Synopsys DWC_usb3 Host Controller Databook v2.50a
  sections
  6.1.5 and 6.4.

  UAHC registers may also be accessed by presenting an NCB-type address over
  RSL. Registers accessed this way are statically mapped from UAHC's
  little-endian mode to the RSL's big-endian.

  == UPHY =================================================

  The USB PHYs have control and status registers accessible via an indirect
  mechanism using the UCTL.PORT*_CR_DBG_* registers. For more information,
  see the PHY Databook.

        description: |
          This command allows any device notification to be transmitted, using the notification type
          and notification parameters specified in the DGCMDPAR register.
            USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[3:0]  = Notification Type
            USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[31:4] = Notification parameters, depends on the notification
          type
          For example, to transmit a Function Wake, software sets USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[3:0] to
          1, and USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[10:4] to the Interface Number.

          This field relates to the Notification Type Specific field in a Device Notification
          Transaction Packet as described in Section 8.5.6 of the USB3 Specification. The
          following bits of the DGCMDPAR register have been put into the corresponding
          DWORD described in Section 8.5.6 of the USB3 Specification:
            USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[3:0]   into DWORD 1[7:4]  (Notification Type)
            USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[27:4]  into DWORD 1[31:8] (Notification Type Specific)
            USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[31:28] into DWORD 2[3:0]  (Notification Type Specific)
          There is one exception for the Bus Interval Adjustment Device Notification:
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[19:4] represents the Bus Interval Adjustment field; however,
          in the USB3 specification, the Bus Interval Adjustment field is actually at 31:16 of DWORD
          1.
          In the case of Host Role Request, USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[3:0] = 4, and
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[5:4] = RSP Phase.

          1. Configure EP0 as a non-stream capable Bulk OUT endpoint with the desired MaxPacketSize.
          2. Configure EP1 as a non-stream capable Bulk IN endpoint assigned to Tx-FIFO 0 with the
             desired MaxPacketSize.
          3. Issue this command with Parameter[0] set to '1', enabling Loopback mode.
          4. Issue Start Transfer to EP0.
          5. Issue Start Transfer to EP1.
          6. The core reads data from the IN buffers and writes it back to the OUT buffers.
             The IN and OUT must have an equal amount of data buffer. The Tx-FIFO 0 default value of
             66 should be changed to 130 for loopback mode.
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DGCMDPAR[0] = When 1, enables Loopback mode. When 0, disables Loopback
          mode.

          BIST fast-clear mode select.
          There are 2 major modes of BIST: full and clear. Full BIST is run by the BIST state
          machine when clear_bist is deasserted during BIST. Clear BIST is run if clear_bist is
          asserted during BIST. A Clear BIST run will simply clear all entries in USBDRD RAMs to
          0x0.
          To avoid race conditions, software must first perform a CSR write operation that puts the
          clear_bist setting into the correct state and then perform another CSR write operation to
          set the BIST trigger (keeping the clear_bist state constant).
          CLEAR BIST completion is indicated by USBDRD(0..1)_UCTL_BIST_STATUS[NDONE]. A BIST clear
          operation takes almost 2,000 host-controller-clock cycles for the largest RAM.

          dividers.
          Also, the UCTL, UAHC, and UPHY should be held in software- initiated reset (using
          UPHY_RST, UAHC_RST, UCTL_RST) until BIST is complete.
          BIST defect status can be checked after FULL BIST completion, both of which are indicated

          pcs_rx_los_mask_val[9:0]. This control filters out short, non-compliant LFPS glitches
          sent by a non-compliant host.
          For normal operation, set to a targeted mask interval of 10us (value = 10us / Tref_clk).
          If the USBDRD(0..1)_UCTL_CTL[REF_CLK_DIV2] is used, the value = 10us / (2 * Tref_clk).
            Based on USBDRD(0..1)_UCTL_CTL[REF_CLK_FSEL], and assuming
            USBDRD(0..1)_UCTL_CTL[REF_CLK_DIV2] is set to
            zero, the value of PCS_RX_LOS_MASK_VAL should be:
              Enum   Tref_clk   LOS_MASK
              0x27 = 100MHz   = 0x3E8
              0x07 =  50MHz   = 0x1F4
              0x2A =  24MHz   = 0x0F0
              0x31 =  20MHz   = 0x0C8
              0x38 =  19.2MHz = 0x0C0
          Setting this bus to 0x0 disables masking.
          The value should be defined when the PHY is in reset. Changing this value during operation
          might disrupt normal operation of the link.

      This register can be used to disable ECC checks, insert ECC errors, and debug ECC failures.
      Fields ECC_ERR* are captured when there are no outstanding ECC errors indicated in INTSTAT
      and a new ECC error arrives. Prioritization for multiple events occurring on the same cycle is
      indicated by the ECC_ERR_SOURCE enumeration: highest encoded value has highest priority.
      Fields *ECC_DIS: Disables SBE detection/correction and DBE detection.
      If ECC_DIS is 0x1, then no errors are detected.
      Fields *ECC_FLIP_SYND:  Flip the syndrom[1:0] bits to generate 1-bit/2-bits error for testing.

    description: |
      In a normal case, a Tx burst will start as soon as one packet is prefetched.
      This works well as long as the system bus is faster than the USB3.0 bus (a
      1024-bytes packet takes ~2.2 uS on the USB bus in SuperSpeed mode). If the system bus
      latency is larger than 2.2 uS to access a 1024-byte packet, then starting a burst on 1-packet
      condition leads to an early abort of the burst causing unnecessary performance reduction.
      This register allows the configuration of threshold and burst size
      control. This feature is enabled by [USBTXPKTCNTSEL].
      Transmit Path:
        * The Tx Threshold is controlled by [USBTXPKTCNT], and the Tx burst size is
          controlled by [USBMAXTXBURSTSIZE].
        * Selecting optimal Tx FIFO size, Tx Threshold, and Tx burst size avoids Tx burst aborts due
          to an underrun if the system bus is slower than USB. Once in a while an underrun is OK,
          and there is no functional issue.
        * A larger threshold will affect the performance, since the scheduler is idle during this
          time.

      In a normal case, an Rx burst will start as soon as 1-packet space is available.
      This works well as long as the system bus is faster than the USB3.0 bus (a
      1024-bytes packet takes ~2.2 uS on the USB bus in SuperSpeed mode). If the system bus latency
      is larger than 2.2 uS to access a 1024-byte packet, then starting a burst on 1-packet
      condition leads to an early abort of the burst causing unnecessary performance reduction.
      This register allows the configuration of threshold and burst size control. This feature
      is enabled by USBRXPKTCNTSEL.
      Receive Path:
      * The Rx Threshold is controlled by USBRXPKTCNT and the Rx burst size is controlled
        by USBMAXRXBURSTSIZE.
      * Selecting optimal Rx FIFO size, Rx Threshold, and Rx burst size avoids Rx burst aborts due
        to overrun if the system bus is slower than USB. Once in a while overrun is OK, and there
        is no functional issue.
      * Some devices do not support terminating ACK retry. With these devices Host cannot set ACK=0
        and Retry=0 and do retry later and you have to retry immediately. For such devices,
        minimize retry due to underrun. Setting threshold and burst size guarantees this.
      * A larger Rx threshold affects the performance since the scheduler is idle during this time.

          Power down scale. The USB3 suspend-clock input replaces pipe3_rx_pclk as a clock source to
          a small part of the USB3 core that operates when the SuperSpeed PHY is in its lowest power
          (P3) state, and therefore does not provide a clock. This field specifies how many suspend-
          clock periods fit into a 16 kHz clock period. When performing the division, round up the
          remainder.
          For example, when using an 32-bit PHY and 25-MHz suspend clock, PWRDNSCALE = 25000 kHz/16
          kHz = 1563 (rounded up).
          The minimum suspend-clock frequency is 32 KHz, and maximum suspend-clock frequency is 125
          MHz.
          The LTSSM uses Suspend clock for 12-ms and 100-ms timers during suspend mode. According to
          the USB 3.0 specification, the accuracy on these timers is 0% to +50%.
          12 ms + 0~+50% accuracy = 18 ms  (Range is  12 ms  - 18 ms)
          100 ms + 0~+50% accuracy = 150 ms (Range is 100 ms - 150 ms).
          The suspend clock accuracy requirement is:
          ( 12,000/62.5) * (GCTL[31:19]) * actual suspend_clk_period should be between 12,000 and
          18,000
          (100,000/62.5) * (GCTL[31:19]) * actual suspend_clk_period should be between 100,000 and
          150,000
          For example, if your suspend_clk frequency varies from 7.5 MHz to 10.5MHz, then the value
          needs to programmed is: Power Down Scale = 10500/16 = 657 (rounded up; and fastest
          frequency used)

          Synchronize ITP to reference clock. In host mode, if this bit is set to:
          0 = the core keeps the UTMI/ULPI PHY on the first port in non-suspended state whenever
          there is a SuperSpeed port that is not in Rx.Detect, SS.Disable, and U3 state.
          1 = the core keeps the UTMI/ULPI PHY on the first port in non-suspended state whenever the
          other non-SuperSpeed ports are not in suspended state.
          This feature is useful because it saves power by suspending UTMI/ULPI when SuperSpeed only
          is active and it helps resolve when the PHY does not transmit a host resume unless it is
          placed in suspend state.
          This bit must be programmed as a part of initialization at power-on reset, and must not be
          dynamically changed afterwards.
          Note: USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_USB2PHYCFG[*][SUSPHY] eventually decides to put the UTMI/ULPI PHY
          into suspend state. In addition, when this bit is set to 1, the core generates ITP off of
          the REF_CLK-based counter. Otherwise, ITP and SOF are generated off of UTMI/ULPI_CLK[0]
          based counter. To program the reference clock period inside the core, refer to
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_GUCTL[REFCLKPER].
          INTERNAL: If you do not plan to ever use this feature or the

          REF_CLK.
          Note: If you plan to enable hardware-based LPM (PORTPMSC.HLE = 1), this feature cannot be
          used. Turn off this feature by setting this bit to zero and use the

      When the AXI Master Bus returns "Error" response, the "SoC Bus Error" is generated. In the
      Host mode, the host_system_err port indicates this condition. In addition, it is also
      indicated in the USBSTS.HSE field.
      Due to the nature of AXI, it is possible that multiple AXI transactions are active at a time.
      The Host Controller does not keep track of the start address of all outstanding
      transactions. Instead, it keeps track of the start address of the DMA transfer associated
      with all active transactions. It is this address that is reported in the GBUSERRADDR when
      a bus error occurs.
      For example, if the Host Controller initiates a DMA transfer to write 1k of packet data
      starting at buffer address 0xABCD0000, and this DMA is broken up into multiple 256B bursts
      on the AXI, then if a bus error occurs on any of these associated AXI transfers, the
      GBUSERRADDR reflects the DMA start address of 0xABCD0000 regardless of which AXI transaction
      received the error.

          High/FullSpeed timeout calibration.
          The number of PHY clock cycles, as indicated by the application in this field, is
          multiplied by a bit-time factor; this factor is added to the HighSpeed/FullSpeed
          interpacket timeout duration in the core to account for additional delays introduced by
          the PHY. This might be required, since the delay introduced by the PHY in generating the
          linestate condition can vary among PHYs.
          The USB standard timeout value for HighSpeed operation is 736 to 816 (inclusive) bit
          times. The USB standard timeout value for FullSpeed operation is 16 to 18 (inclusive) bit
          times. The application must program this field based on the speed of connection.
          The number of bit times added per PHY clock are:
          HighSpeed operation:
          - one 30-MHz PHY clock = 16 bit times
          - one 60-MHz PHY clock = 8 bit times
          FullSpeed operation:
          - one 30-MHz PHY clock = 0.4 bit times
          - one 60-MHz PHY clock = 0.2 bit times
          - one 48-MHz PHY clock = 0.25 bit times

          a compliance state, which allows testing of the PIPE PHY compliance patterns without
          having to have a test fixture on the USB 3.0 cable. By default, this bit should be set

          The sequence for using this functionality is as follows:
          Disconnect any plugged in devices.
          Set USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_USBCMD[HCRST] = 1 or power-on-chip reset.
          Set USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_PORTSC[PP] = 0.
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 1. This places the link into compliance state.
          To advance the compliance pattern, follow this sequence (toggle HSTPRTCMPL):
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 0.
          Set HSTPRTCMPL = 1. Toggle the HSTPRTCMPL bit to advance the link to the next compliance
          pattern.

    description: |
      This register holds the number of valid bytes in the Event Buffer. During initialization,
      software must initialize the count by writing 0 to the Event Count field. Each time the
      hardware writes a new event to the Event Buffer, it increments this count. Most events
      are four bytes, but some events may span over multiple four byte entries. Whenever the
      count is greater than zero, the hardware raises the corresponding interrupt
      line (depending on the USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_GEVNTSIZ(0)[EVNTINTMASK]). On an interrupt, software
      processes one or more events out of the Event Buffer. Afterwards, software must write the
      Event Count field with the number of bytes it processed.
      Clock crossing delays may result in the interrupt's continual assertion after software
      acknowledges the last event. Therefore, when the interrupt line is asserted, software must
      read the GEVNTCOUNT register and only process events if the GEVNTCOUNT is greater than 0.

    description: |
      This register specifies the relative DMA priority level among the Device TXFIFOs (one per IN
      endpoint).
      Each register bit[n] controls the priority (1: high, 0: low) of each TXFIFO[n]. When multiple
      TXFIFOs compete for DMA service at a given time (i.e., multiple TXQs contain TX DMA requests
      and their corresponding TXFIFOs have space available), the TX DMA arbiter grants access on a
      packet-basis in the following manner:
        1. High-priority TXFIFOs are granted access using round-robin arbitration
        2. Low-priority TXFIFOs are granted access using round-robin arbitration only after the
           high-priority TXFIFOs have no further processing to do (i.e., either the TXQs are empty
           or the corresponding TXFIFOs are full).
      For scatter-gather packets, the arbiter grants successive DMA requests to the same FIFO until
      the entire packet is completed.
      When configuring periodic IN endpoints, software must set register bit[n]=1, where n is the
      TXFIFO assignment. This ensures that the DMA for isochronous or interrupt IN endpoints are
      prioritized over bulk or control IN endpoints.
      This register is present only when the core is configured to operate in the device mode
      (includes DRD and OTG modes). The register size corresponds to the number of Device IN
      endpoints.

      This register specifies the relative DMA priority level among the Host TXFIFOs (one per USB

      on a packet-basis in the following manner:
        1. Among the FIFOs in the same speed group (SuperSpeed or HighSpeed/FullSpeed/LowSpeed):

          This field indicates the frame length adjustment to be applied when
          SOF/ITP counter is running off of the ref_clk.
          This register value is used to adjust

          This bit only affects stream-capable bulk endpoints.
          When this bit is set to 0x0 and the controller receives a Data Packet with the
          Packet Pending (PP) bit set to 0 for OUT endpoints, or it receives an ACK
          with the NumP field set to 0 and PP set to 0 for IN endpoints, the core
          attempts to search for another stream (CStream) to initiate to the host.
          However, there are two situations where this behavior is not optimal:
           - When the host is setting PP=0 even though it has not finished the
          stream, or
           - When the endpoint on the device is configured with one transfer
          resource and therefore does not have any other streams to initiate to the
          host.
          When this bit is set to 0x1, the core ignores the Packet Pending bit for the
          purposes of stream selection and does not search for another stream when
          it receives DP(PP=0) or ACK(NumP=0, PP=0). This can enhance the

          Run/Stop.
          The software writes 1 to this bit to start the device controller operation.
          To stop the device controller operation, the software must remove any active
          transfers and write 0 to this bit. When the controller is stopped, it sets the
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DSTS[DEVCTRLHLT] bit when the core is idle and the lower layer finishes
          the disconnect process.
          The Run/Stop bit must be used in following cases as specified:
             1. After power-on reset and CSR initialization, the software must write 1 to this bit
             to start the device controller. The controller does not signal connect to the host
             until this bit is set.
             2. The software uses this bit to control the device controller to perform a soft
             disconnect. When the software writes 0 to this bit, the host does not see that
             the device is connected. The device controller stays in the disconnected state
             until the software writes 1 to this bit. The minimum duration of keeping this bit
             cleared is 30ms in SuperSpeed and 10ms in High/Full/LowSpeed.
             If the software attempts a connect after the soft disconnect or detects a
             disconnect event, it must set USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DCTL[ULSTCHNGREQ] to
             "Rx.Detect" before reasserting the Run/Stop bit.
             INTERNAL: 3. When the USB or Link is in a lower power state and the Two Power Rails
             configuration is selected, software writes 0 to this bit to indicate that it is going
             to turn off the Core Power Rail. After the software turns on the Core Power Rail
             again and re-initializes the device controller, it must set this bit to start the
             device controller. For more details, see Low Power Operation on page 599.

            GUSB3PIPECTLn registers, DCFG, DCTL, DEVTEN, DSTS
          - All module state machines (except the SoC Bus Slave Unit) are reset to the
             IDLE state, and all the TxFIFOs and the RxFIFO are flushed.
          - Any transactions on the SoC bus Master are terminated as soon as possible,
            after gracefully completing the last data phase of a SoC bus transfer. Any
            transactions on the USB are terminated immediately.
          The application can write this bit at any time to reset the core. This is a self-clearing
          bit; the core clears this bit after all necessary logic is reset in the core,
          which may take several clocks depending on the corefs current state. Once this
          bit is cleared, the software must wait at least 3 PHY clocks before accessing the
          PHY domain (synchronization delay). Typically, software reset is used during
          software development and also when you dynamically change the PHY selection
          bits in the USB configuration registers listed above. When you change the PHY,
          the corresponding clock for the PHY is selected and used in the PHY domain.
          Once a new clock is selected, the PHY domain must be reset for proper
          operation.

          USB/Link State Change Request.
          Software writes this field to issue a USB/Link state change request. A change in
          this field indicates a new request to the core. If software wants to issue the same
          request back-to-back, it must write a 0 to this field between the two requests. The
          result of the state change request is reflected in USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DSTS[USBLNKST].
          These bits are self-cleared on the MAC Layer exiting suspended state.
          If software is updating other fields of the USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DCTL register and not
          intending to force any link state change, then it must write a 0 to this field.
          SuperSpeed Compliance mode is normally entered and controlled by the remote link
          partner. Refer to the USB3 specification. Alternatively, you can force the local link
          directly into Compliance mode, by resetting the SuperSpeed link with the
          USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DCTL[RS] bit set to zero. If you then write 0xA to the ULSTCHNGREQ
          field and 1 to USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DCTL[RS], the Link will go to Compliance. Once you
          are in Compliance, you may alternately write 0x0 and 0xA to this field to advance
          the compliance pattern.

          This field indicates if a USB endpoint is active in the current configuration
          and interface. It applies to USB IN endpoints 0-15 and OUT endpoints 0-15,
          with one bit for each of the 32 possible endpoints. Even numbers are for
          USB OUT endpoints, and odd numbers are for USB IN endpoints, as
          follows:
           Bit[0]: USB EP0-OUT
           Bit[1]: USB EP0-IN
           Bit[2]: USB EP1-OUT
           Bit[3]: USB EP1-IN
          The entity programming this register must set bits 0 and 1 because they
          enable control endpoints that map to physical endpoints (resources) after
          USBReset.
          Application software clears these bits for all endpoints (other than EP0-OUT
          and EP0-IN) after detecting a USB reset. After receiving SetConfiguration
          and SetInterface requests, the application must program endpoint registers
          accordingly and set these bits.

      This register enables software to issue physical endpoint-specific commands. This register
      contains command, control, and status fields relevant to the current generic command,
      while the USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DEPCMDPAR* registers provide command parameters and return
      status information.
      Several fields (including CMDTYPE) are write-only, so their read values are undefined. After
      power-on, prior to issuing the first endpoint command, the read value of this register is
      undefined. In particular, the CMDACT bit may be set after power-on. In this case, it is safe
      to issue an endpoint command.

          Command or Event Parameters.
          When this register is written:
            Command Parameters:
              For Start Transfer command:
                - [31:16]: StreamID. The USB StreamID assigned to this transfer
              For Start Transfer command applied to an isochronous endpoint:
                - [31:16]: StartMicroFramNum: Indicates the (micro)frame number to
                which the first TRB applies
              For Update Transfer, End Transfer, and Start New Configuration
              commands:
                - [22:16]: Transfer Resource Index (XferRscIdx). The hardware-assigned
                transfer resource index for the transfer, which was returned
                in response to the Start Transfer command. The application
                software-assigned transfer resource index for a Start New
                Configuration command.
          When this register is read:
            Event Parameters:
              For XferNotReady, XferComplete, and Stream events on Bulk Endpoints:
                - [31:16]: StreamID. Applies only to bulk endpoints that support streams. This
                           indicates the StreamID of the transfer for which the event is
                           generated
              For XferInProgress:
                - [31:16]: Isochronous Microframe Number (IsocMicroFrameNum): Indicates the
                           microframe number of the beginning of the interval that generated
                           the XferInProgress event (debug purposes only)
              For XferNotReady events on Isochronous Endpoints:
                - [31:16]: Isochronous Microframe Number (IsocMicroFrameNum). Indicates the
                           microframe number during which the endpoint was not ready
                Note: controller core represents USB bus time as a 14-bit value on the bus and also
                in the DSTS register (USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DSTS[SOFFN]), but as a 16-bit value in the
                XferNotReady event. Use the 16-bit value to interact with Isochronous endpoints via
                the StartXfer command. The extra two bits that the controller core produces will be
                necessary for handling wrap-around conditions in the interaction between software
                and hardware.
              EPCmdCmplt events
                For all EPCmdCmplt events
                  - [27:24]: Command Type. The command type that completed (Valid only in a DEPEVT
                             event. Undefined when read from the
                             USBDRD(0..1)_UAHC_DEPCMD(0..15)[COMMANDPARAM] field).
                For EPCmdCmplt event in response to Start Transfer command:
                  - [22:16]: Transfer Resource Index (XferRscIdx). The internal hardware transfer
                             resource index assigned to this transfer. This index must be used in
                             all Update Transfer and End Transfer commands.

          Command Completion Status.
          Additional information about the completion of this command is available in
          this field.
          Within an XferNotReady event:
            [15]: Indicates the reason why the XferNotReady event is generated:
              - 0: XferNotActive: Host initiated a transfer, but the requested transfer is not
                present in the hardware
              - 1: XferActive: Host initiated a transfer, the transfer is present, but no valid TRBs
                are available
            [14]: Not Used
            [13:12]: For control endpoints, indicates what stage was requested when the transfer was
            not ready:
              - 0x1: Control Data Request
              - 0x2: Control Status Request
          Within an XferComplete or XferInProgress event:
            [15]: LST bit of the completed TRB (XferComplete only)
            [15]: MissedIsoc: Indicates the interval did not complete successfully (XferInProgress
            only)
            [14]: IOC bit of the TRB that completed
            [13]: Indicates the TRB completed with a short packet reception or the last packet of an
            isochronous interval
            [12]: Reserved
            If the host aborts the data stage of a control transfer, software may receive a
            XferComplete event with the EventStatus field equal to 0. This is a valid event
            that must be processed as a part of the Control Transfer Programming Model.
            INTERNAL: For abort handling, see also Synopsys DWC_usb3 Databook v2.50a, Section 8.4.
          Within a Stream Event:
            [15:12]:
              - 0x2: StreamNotFound: This stream event is issued when the stream-capable endpoint
                performed a search in its transfer resource cache, but could not find an active
                and ready stream.
              - 0x1: StreamFound: This stream event is issued when the stream-capable endpoint found
                an active and ready stream in its transfer resource cache, and initiated traffic for
                that stream to the host. The ID of the selected Stream is in the EventParam field.
          In response to a Start Transfer command:
            [15:12]:
              - 0x2: Indicates expiry of the bus time reflected in the Start Transfer command.
              - 0x1: Indicates there is no transfer resource available on the endpoint.
          In response to a Set Transfer Resource (DEPXFERCFG) command:
            [15:12]:
              - 0x1: Indicates an error has occurred because software is requesting more transfer
                resources to be assigned than have been configured in the hardware.
          In response to a End Transfer command:
            [15:12]:
              - 0x1: Indicates an invalid transfer resource was specified.
