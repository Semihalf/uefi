          For SPD settings that configure a non-default reference clock, hardware updates the PLL
          settings of the specific lane mode (LMODE) table entry to derive the correct link rate.

          Note that a value of 0xF is called SW_MODE. The CCPI link does not come up configured in

          (Software must do all the CCPI GSER configuration to use CCPI in the case of SW_MODE.)
          When SPD!=SW_MODE after a chip cold reset, the hardware has initialized the following
          registers (based on the OCI_SPD selection):

           * GSER()_LANE()_RX_VALBBD_CTRL_1.

        description: |
          The GSER uses electrical idle inference to determine when a RX lane has reentered
          electrical idle (EI). The PHY electrical idle exit detection supports a minimum pulse
          width of 400ps, therefore configurations that run faster than 2.5G can indicate EI when
          the serial lines are still driven. For rates faster than 2.5G, it takes 16K * 8 UI of
          consecutive deasserted GSER()_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIESTS] for the GSER to infer EI. In the
          event of electrical idle inference, the following happens:
          * GSER()_RX_EIE_DETSTS[CDRLOCK]<lane> is zeroed.
          * GSER()_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIELTCH]<lane> is zeroed.
          * GSER()_RX_EIE_DETSTS[EIESTS]<lane> is zeroed.
          * GSER()_RX_COAST[COAST]<lane> is asserted to prevent the CDR from trying to lock on
          the incoming data stream.
          * GSER()_RX_EIE_DETEN[EIEDE]<lane> deasserts for a short period of time, and then is
          asserted to begin looking for the Electrical idle Exit condition.

          Writing this register to a non-zero value causes the electrical idle inference to use the
          EII_FILT count instead of the default settings. Each EII_FILT count represents 20 ns of
          incremental EI inference time.

          It is not expected that software will need to use the Electrical Idle Inference logic.

      These registers are only reset by hardware during chip cold reset.
