    description: |
      Any exception event that occurs is captured in the PIP_INT_REG.
      PIP_INT_REG will set the exception bit regardless of the value
      of PIP_INT_EN.  PIP_INT_EN only controls if an interrupt is
      raised to software.

      "* TODOOVR
      The PIP Todo list stores packets that have been received and require work
      queue entry generation.  PIP will normally assert backpressure when the
      list fills up such that any error is normally is result of a programming
      the PIP_BCK_PRS[HIWATER] incorrectly.  PIP itself can handle 29M
      packets/sec @500MHz or 15Gbs @ 64B packets.
      * SKPRUNT
      If a packet size is less then the amount programmed in the per port
      skippers, then there will be nothing to parse and the entire packet will
      basically be skipped over.  This is probably not what the user desired, so
      there is an indication to software.
      * BADTAG
      A tag is considered bad when it is resued by a new packet before it was
      released by PIP.  PIP considers a tag released by one of two methods.
      . QOS dropped so that it is released over the pip__ipd_release bus.
      . WorkQ entry is validated by the pip__ipd_done signal
      * PRTNXA
      If PIP receives a packet that is not in the valid port range, the port
      processed will be mapped into the valid port space (the mapping is
      currently unpredictable) and the PRTNXA bit will be set.  PRTNXA will be
      set for packets received under the following conditions:
      * packet ports (ports 0-31)
      GMX_INF_MODE[TYPE]==0 (SGMII), received port is 4-15 or 20-31
      GMX_INF_MODE[TYPE]==1 (XAUI),  received port is 1-15 or 17-31
      * upper ports (pci and loopback ports 32-63)
      received port is 40-47 or 52-63
      * BCKPRS
      PIP can assert backpressure to the receive logic when the todo list
      exceeds a high-water mark (see PIP_BCK_PRS for more details).  When this
      occurs, PIP can raise an interrupt to software.
      * CRCERR
      Octane can compute CRC in two places.  Each RGMII port will compute its
      own CRC, but PIP can provide an additional check or check loopback or
      PCI ports. If PIP computes a bad CRC, then PIP will raise an interrupt.
      * PKTDRP
      PIP can drop packets based on QOS results received from IPD.  If the QOS
      algorithm decides to drop a packet, PIP will assert an interrupt."

      Global control information.  These are the global checker enables for
      IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP parsing.  The enables effect all ports.
    internal: |
      The following text describes the conditions in which each checker will
      assert and flag an exception.  By disabling the checker, the exception will
      not be flagged and the packet will be parsed as best it can.  Note, by
      disabling conditions, packets can be parsed incorrectly (.i.e. IP_MAL and
      L4_MAL could cause bits to be seen in the wrong place.  IP_CHK and L4_CHK
      means that the packet was corrupted).
      * IP_CHK
      Indicates that an IPv4 packet contained an IPv4 header checksum
      violations.  Only applies to packets classified as IPv4.
      * IP_MAL
      Indicates that the packet was malformed.  Malformed packets are defined as
      packets that are not long enough to cover the IP header or not long enough
      to cover the length in the IP header.
      * IP_HOP
      Indicates that the IPv4 TTL field or IPv6 HOP field is zero.
      * IP4_OPTS
      Indicates the presence of IPv4 options.  It is set when the length != 5.
      This only applies to packets classified as IPv4.
      * IP6_EEXT
      Indicate the presence of IPv6 early extension headers.  These bits only
      apply to packets classified as IPv6.  Bit 0 will flag early extensions
      when next_header is any one of the following...
      hop-by-hop (0)
      destination (60)
      routing (43)
      Bit 1 will flag early extentions when next_header is NOT any of the
      following...
      TCP (6)
      UDP (17)
      fragmentation (44)
      ICMP (58)
      IPSEC ESP (50)
      IPSEC AH (51)
      IPCOMP
      * L4_MAL
      Indicates that a TCP or UDP packet is not long enough to cover the TCP or
      UDP header.
      * L4_PRT
      Indicates that a TCP or UDP packet has an illegal port number either the
      source or destination port is zero.
      * L4_CHK
      Indicates that a packet classified as either TCP or UDP contains an L4
      checksum failure
      * L4_LEN
      Indicates that the TCP or UDP length does not match the the IP length.
      * TCP_FLAG
      Indicates any of the following conditions...
      {URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN} : tcp_flag
      6'b000001: (FIN only)
      6'b000000: (0)

      In normal configurations, OFFSET must be set in the 0..4 range to allow the
      entire IP and TCP/UDP headers to be buffered in HW and calculate the L4
      checksum for TCP/UDP packets.
      The MAX value of OFFSET is determined by the the types of packets that can
      be sent to PIP as follows...
      Packet Type                 MAX OFFSET

      IPv6/TCP/UDP                 5
      IPv6/without L4 parsing  6
      If the L4 can be ignored, then the MAX OFFSET for IPv6 packets can increase
      to 6.  Here are the following programming restrictions for IPv6 packets and
      OFFSET==6:
      . PIP_GBL_CTL[TCP_FLAG] == 0

      "PIP Statistics Counters
      Note: special stat counter behavior
      1) Read and write operations must arbitrate for the statistics resources
      along with the packet engines which are incrementing the counters.
      In order to not drop packet information, the packet HW is always a
      higher priority and the CSR requests will only be satisified when
      there are idle cycles.  This can potentially cause long delays if the
      system becomes full.
      2) stat counters can be cleared in two ways.  If PIP_STAT_CTL[RDCLR] is
      set, then all read accesses will clear the register.  In addition,
      any write to a stats register will also reset the register to zero.
      Please note that the clearing operations must obey rule #1 above.
      3) all counters are wrapping - software must ensure they are read periodically
      4) The counters accumulate statistics for packets that are sent to PKI.  If
      PTP_MODE is enabled, the 8B timestamp is prepended to the packet.  This
      additional 8B of data is captured in the octet counts.

          The HW considers an IPv4 packet to be multicast
          when the most-significant nibble of the 32-bit
          destination address is 0xE (i.e. it is a class D
          address). The HW considers an IPv6 packet to be
          multicast when the most-significant byte of the
          128-bit destination address is all 1's.
          Only applies when the parse mode for the packet
          is SKIP-TO-L2 and the packet is IP or the parse
          mode for the packet is SKIP-TO-IP.

          Enable the alternate skip selector
          When enabled, the HW is able to recompute the
          SKIP I value based on the packet contents.
          Up to two of the initial 64 bits of the header
          are used along with four PIP_ALT_SKIP_CFGx to
          determine the updated SKIP I value.
          The bits of the packet used should be present in
          all packets.
          PIP_PRT_CFG[DSA_EN,HIGIG_EN] must be disabled
          when ALT_SKP_EN is set.
          ALT_SKP_EN must not be set for DPI ports (32-35)
          when a PKT_INST_HDR is present.
          ALT_SKP_EN should not be enabled for ports which
          have GMX_RX_FRM_CTL[PTP_MODE] set as the timestamp
          will be prepended onto the initial 64 bits of the
          packet.
