CN88XX
======

Overview
--------

The CN88XX chips contain a large amount of L2 cache. This allows
the BDK to run on these chips without DRAM setup. In addition, the BDK
supports a multi-node setup (NUMA).

Supported boot options for CN88XX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* SPI NOR flash
* MMC, eMMC, or an SD card

Getting flash programmed the first time
---------------------------------------

It is generally easiest if the boot flash is programmed before it is
installed it on the board.  If this wasn't done, the BDK supports
programming flash using a combination of EJTAG/PCIe and serial over UART0.
For the various boot options, the BDK supplies binary images that must be
programmed into the beginning of flash.  Here is a list of images:

* Booting from SPI NOR flash
** bdk-boot-spi-cn88xx.bin
* Booting from MMC, eMMC, or an SD card
** bdk-boot-emmc-cn88xx.bin

Using Xmodem to program flash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Booting the Xmodem loader
* Connect a serial terminal application to UART0
** Use a baudrate of 115200, no parity, one stop bit
* Boot `bdk-xmodem-load.bin` using bdk-remote.
+
----
 export OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL=<protocol>
 bdk-remote boot target-bin/bdk-xmodem-load.bin
----
* The output from `bdk-xmodem-load.bin` should be visible in the terminal
application.
+
.Example Xmodem loader output
----
include::captures/bdk-xmodem-load.capture[]
----

.Loading an image
* Choose the menu option of what type of flash you want to program.
+
----
2) Load file into parallel NOR
----
* Input the offset into the flash to start programming. This is normally zero.
+
----
(INS)Offset into flash [0]:
----
* Start Xmodem send in your terminal application.
** Observe the progress of Xmodem in your terminal application.
* Once Xmodem completes without errors, the flash is programmed.
+
----
Xmodem complete
----
* Perfrom a soft reset of the chip to boot the new image.
+
----
bdk-remote reset
----

NOTE: Performing a soft reset from the menu item might appear to hang. The
EJTAG probe can stop the core on reset for debugging. This is why you should
use *bdk-remote* instead of the menu option here.

Using PCIe to program flash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Programming MMC, eMMC, or an SD card over PCIe
----
export OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL=PCI
bdk-remote mmc write bdk-boot-emmc-cn88xx.bin 0
bdk-remote reset
----

.Programming SPI NOR flash over PCIe
----
export OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL=PCI
TBD
bdk-remote reset
----

If all else fails, the very slow method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If programming flash using the above steps fails for some reason, it is
possible to program parallel NOR, MMC, eMMC, and SD using only EJTAG.
This method is exceedingly slow and should be only used when nothing else
works.  This would be identical to the PCIe programming steps above,
except the *OCTEON_REMOTE_PROTOCOL* would be setup for EJTAG.

NOTE: This method of programming is prohibitively slow.  A normal size
bootloader takes 1-2 days to load into parallel NOR.  MMC, eMMC, and SD
are faster, but still quite slow.


Using the BDK on CN88XX
-----------------------

After programming the BDK into flash and performing a reset, the BDK
application should boot and show the following output.

.Example Successful Boot
----
include::captures/boot_messages.capture[]
include::captures/main_menu.capture[]
Menu choice: (0INS)>
----

Configure the SERDES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The eight QLM interfaces on CN88XX must be configured before they
can be used.  Under the *SERDES configuration* menu option, choose *Change
QLM/DLM configuration* to interactively configure the interfaces.  Note
that these interfaces must be manually configured after every chip reset
or power cycle.  Settings are not saved.

.Example SERDES configuration
----
include::captures/qlm_sub_menu_cn78xx.capture[]
----

Configure the BDK software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most boards have networing PHYs or other components that the BDK needs to
be configured for.  These are setup under the *Software configuration*
menu.

.Example Software configuration
----
include::captures/configure_menu_cn78xx.capture[]

Next steps
~~~~~~~~~~

After completeing the steps in this document, the BDK is properly
configured for the CN88XX board.  Now the other menu options are
available for testing out various IO connections.
