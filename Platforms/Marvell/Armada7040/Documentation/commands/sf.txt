SF (SPI Flash) command
----------------------
sf UEFI command is used to write/read/erase SPI flash memory.

Syntax
------
sf [help] [probe] [read] [write] [erase] [update] [-d] [-a <Address>]
[-o <Offset>] [-l <Length>] [-f <FilePath>]

Usage
-----
On of the read/write/erase modes must be specified. Erase requires only Offset
and Length, but read, write and update requires Offset, Length and Address or
FileName.
probe  - check response from SPI flash by reading its ID
read   - read from SPI flash Offset into RAM Address or into file
write  - write data from RAM Address or from file into SPI flash at Offset
erase  - erase data in SPI flash at Offset (must be 0x10000 aligned)
update - update data from RAM Address or from file into SPI flash at Offset
-d     - dump memory read from SPI flash, only with read mode
help   - show help massage
Address - address in RAM of data to be copied/stored (in hex)
Offset  - offset in SPI flash to read/write (in hex)
Length  - number of bytes to read/write/erase (in hex or dec)
FilePath - path to file to read data into or write/update data from

Examples
--------
Check if there is response from SPI flash
  sf probe
Read 32 bytes from 0xe00000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x100000
  sf read -a 0x100000 -o 0xe00000 -l 32
Read 0x20 bytes from 0x200000 of SPI flash into RAM at address 0x300000 and print output
  sf read -a 0x300000 -o 0x200000 -l 0x20 -d
Erase 0x10000 bytes from offset 0x100000 of SPI flash
  sf erase -o 0x100000 -l 0x100000
Write 16 bytes from 0x200000 at RAM into SPI flash at address 0x4000000
  sf write -a 0x200000 -o 0x4000000 -l 16
Update 100 bytes from 0x100000 at RAM in SPI flash at address 0xe00000
  sf update -a 0x100000 -o 0xe00000 -l 100
Read 0x3000 bytes from 0x0 of SPI flash into file fs2:file.bin
  sf read -o 0x0 -l 0x3000 -f fs2:file.bin
Update data in SPI flash at 0x3000000 from file Linux.efi
  sf update -o 0x3000000 -f Linux.efi

Notes
-----
1. Reading from SPI flash into file which does not exist, creates one.
2. Reading from SPI flash into file which has smaller size than Length
   parameter, enlarges this file.
3. Reading into file overrides its previous content.
