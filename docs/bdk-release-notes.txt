== thunder-release-v1.24.4 ==
* eMMC
** Fix bug where the address didn't increment during writes
* CRB-2S
** Remove Cortina PHY reset as it isn't required for the latest ROM
** Apply better tuning parameters to QLM0-1, for networking

== thunder-release-v1.24.3 ==
* CCPI
** Display the BDK version of node 1 during boot.  The BDK version of both
nodes must match, so a fatal error will be raised if the version on both
nodes doesn't match.  The error message "FATAL: Mismatched BDK versions
between nodes" will be displayed when the nodes don't match.

== thunder-release-v1.24.2 ==
* CCPI
** Clear CCPI link TX retry and RX block error counters after CCPI init. RX
block error counters were causing false error reporting during UEFI.
* DRAM
** Fix missing arguments to debug_print() found by cppcheck
* Device Tree
** Device tree now uses qsgmii instead of sgmii tag for QSGMII mode GSER
** Fix trace help comment to refer to correct file
** Clarify the description of channel loss
** Fix PEM trimming on node-1
** Small optimization when deleting PEM to use already obtained fdt offset.
** Rewrite "qlm-mode" trimming
** refclkuaa to exact value.
** Changed "pci-host-ecam-generic" property replacement to not truncate
property value, and take effect in more cases.
** Fix patching of /memory@ nodes.
* CN81XX / CN80XX
** Hide the 'E' option in the boot menu for CN81XX/CN80XX. The L2 Cache on
CN81XX and CN80XX is too small to run diagnostics without DRAM. Don't show
this boot option on these chips.
** Fix detection of alternate package for CN80XX.
** Report a single lane for DLM0-1 on CN80XX.
** Update serdes config menu for CN80XX.
** Properly do MCU autoconfig when a DLM only has 1 lane. Applies to CN80XX.

== thunder-release-v1.24.1 ==
* CCPI
** Fix bug where CCPI pre/post for node 0 was using node 1 values.  Node 0
was mistakenly using pre and post tuning values meant for node 1.  This
bug is normally harmless because most systems use the same tuning values
for both nodes.
** Fix bug where CCPI tuning parameters would default to zero.  Due to how
image handoff works in the BDK, the function bdk_init_ccpi_early() is only
called in the first image and not following images.  This is the expected
and correct behavior.  The bug was that the CCPI lane state was
initialized in this function instead of bdk_init_ccpi_connection().  This
caused the defaults for CCPI lane tuning to be lost.

== thunder-release-v1.24 ==
* DRAM
** Fix possible skip of ECC update in memory owned by the BDK
** Enhance read-leveling bitmasks printing
** Allow old TRP field calculation in TIMING_PARAMS0
** Fix the calculated ECC byte validity check
** Do not skip RODT rows for 1-rank 2-slot configurations
** Initial 32-bit mode support for 81xx/80xx
** Fix uses of RTT_WR
** Keep all rows for RL if single rank DIMM
** Use RTT_WR of 80 ohms for both 1-rank DIMM configurations
** Handle RTT_WR usage for 88XX pass 1
** Re-arrange read-leveling sampling order
** Change RTT_PARK and RODT for 1-rank 2-slot configurations
** Use 100MHz refclk with all RDIMM types when required

* Networking
** Properly detect link down status for XAUI
** Marvell RXAUI PHY needs reset and updated param
** Disabling filtering of mcast so we get backpressure counters
** Fix bug causing corruption of BGXX_CMRX_RX_DMAC_CTL
** Use BGX hw counters for tx packets and octets

* CCPI
** Toggle the lane bad bit when we don't get a lane up
** Once training RX ready is set, never clear it or ask for updates
** Use GTI timestamps to improve multi-node synchronization
** 6.25G using RX equalization requires another delay in ready checks

* PCIe
** Set SLIX_M2S_MACX_CTL[waitl_com] for more strict ordering
** Show friendly name for internal devices during ecam scan
** Add discovery of virtual functions

* SATA
** Perform a HBA reset during init

* SERDES
** Remove code skipping QLM setup if we're already in the correct mode
** Treat any refclk less than 1Mhz as zero

* SNT
** Add detection of Nitrox through checking fuse 231 (0xe7)

* Misc
** Correct display of binary data in the device tree
** Report failure if fatfs-tool can't copy a file
** Fix issue where "keys" in a menu says it was a invalid command
** Add the chip serial number to the device tree during init
** Update expected CPT fuses for CN81XX and CN80XX models
** Fix UAA device entry
** Fix issue where trace output could say a FDT was updated when it wasn't
** Don't use compiler builtins for compare and swap
** Add required 300Mhz offset for decode of MIO_FUS_DAT3[core_pll_mul]
** Add setup menu for choosing tracing levels

== thunder-release-v1.23.14 ==
* TWSI
** Fix CSR name typo in TWSI bus recovery
* CCPI
** Reset QLM if training is stuck not receiving messages. Under rare
conditions the QLMs can fail to transmit training messages while training
is active. This is seen as one node receiving messages, but not getting
responses from the other for its requests. This shows up as a lane getting
stuck in message check. When this is detected, perform a QLM soft reset to
recover the QLM lanes.
** Show all lanes in one status line. Add a line to CCPI trace that contains
the state of all 24 lanes. This makes it easier to follow all lanes at once.
* Networking
** Only perform BER test on links using 10G SERDES. The BER tests use the
BGXX_SPUX_BR block, which is only active for XFI, 10G-KR, XLAUI, and 40G-KR.
XAUI, DXAUI, and RXAUI don't use this block and can't do the same BER test.

== thunder-release-v1.23.13 ==
* SERDES
** Check for Electrical Idle or CDR loss during RX equalization. RX equalization
requires a continuous signal while it runs. If the lanes enter Electrical Idle
or loose CDR lock, we know the signal dropped while equalization was running.
Mark this as a failure so we will redo RX equalization later. This happens
most often with BGX where the incoming signal may "bounce" during initial
setup.
** Allow RX equalization to be run on any speed link. RX equalization has been
shown to improve the eye even at slow speeds. Allow RX equalization to be run
on any link.
* Networking
** Check for bit errors during BGX link init. For a BGX link to be considered
up, require that it have block lock during the entire up sequence. Also do a
short bit error check to stop link up on false link bounces.
** Report link down if SMU reports a local or remote fault. With Marvell PHYs
and XFI, we've seen cases were local fault gets set after the link is up.
Update the code to check for this condition.
** Fix hard coded constants for PHY fixed speeds. The BGX code mistakenly
used hard coded constants for the fixed PHY speeds. Update the code to use
the symbolic constants.
* DRAM
** Fix memory leak on SPD read failure
** Fix missing brackets on if statement causing spurios output for boards with
less than 4 DRAM controllers in use.
* SATA
** Rewrite SATA init sequence to match AHCI 1.3 spec. AHCI rev 1.3 specifies
"10.1.1 Firmware Specific Initialization". Update the SATA init to exactly
follow this sequence for early init. This removed some processing from
__bdk_qlm_set_sata() and moved it to bdk_sata_initialize().
** Perform a port reset if device fails to become ready. The SATA device
seems to get stuck waiting for the busy bit to clear a small percentage of
the time in the BDK. When this happens, perform a port COMINIT to recover.
This will be done up to three times.

== thunder-release-v1.23.12 ==
* TWSI
** Implement bus recovery after a TWSI timeout

== thunder-release-v1.23.11 ==
* CCPI
** Display the BDK version of node 1 during boot.  The BDK version of both
nodes must match, so a fatal error will be raised if the version on both
nodes doesn't match.  The error message "FATAL: Mismatched BDK versions
between nodes" will be displayed when the nodes don't match.
** Force boot to stop when CCPI fails on systems requiring multi-node
* SATA
** Consolidate QLM+SATA init code into a single common file
** Take SATA PCS out of reset before the GSER PHY
** Improve debug output messages on command failure
** Fix QLM reporting incorrect SATA speed after controller reset
** Increase the SATA init delay to 250ms to workaround Samsung SSD failure
* USB
** Correct USB version check to work with 3.x devices, not just 3.0
** Change all xhci warnings and errors to trace messages
* DRAM
** Improve DDR4 read-leveling accuracy
** Improve performance of 1-rank DIMMs
** Improve performance of 2-slot configurations
** Add support for mini-DIMMs and SO-DIMMs
** Allow read bit-deskew to be disabled
** Detection of 3DS and NV DIMMs
** Improve default DIMM information output.

== thunder-release-v1.23.10 ==
* eMMC
** Fix bug where the address didn't increment during writes
* CRB-2S
** Remove Cortina PHY reset as it isn't required for the latest ROM
** Apply better tuning parameters to QLM0-1, for networking

== thunder-release-v1.23.9 ==
* CCPI
** Clear CCPI link TX retry and RX block error counters after CCPI init. RX
block error counters were causing false error reporting during UEFI.

== thunder-release-v1.23.8 ==
* CCPI
** Fix bug where CCPI pre/post for node 0 was using node 1 values.  Node 0
was mistakenly using pre and post tuning values meant for node 1.  This
bug is normally harmless because most systems use the same tuning values
for both nodes.
** Fix bug where CCPI tuning parameters would default to zero.  Due to how
image handoff works in the BDK, the function bdk_init_ccpi_early() is only
called in the first image and not following images.  This is the expected
and correct behavior.  The bug was that the CCPI lane state was
initialized in this function instead of bdk_init_ccpi_connection().  This
caused the defaults for CCPI lane tuning to be lost.

== thunder-release-v1.23.7 ==
* Add required 300Mhz offset for decode of MIO_FUS_DAT3[core_pll_mul].
Not clear from the documentation, the multiplier read from
MIO_FUS_DAT3[core_pll_mul] has a 300Mhz offset from the actual RCLK speed.
Add this to the code.

== thunder-release-v1.23.6 ==
* SATA
** Perform a HBA reset during init.  Perform a host bus reset to make sure
SATA is good.  This seems to be needed in rare cases.  Without it, SATA
will very rarely fail the first identify.
* CCPI
** 6.25G using RX equalization requires another delay ready checks Through
experiments, CCPI using 6.25G and RX equalization requires a slightly
longer delay than 10G for waiting for the ready state machine.

== thunder-release-v1.23.5 ==
* DRAM
** Fix possible skip of ECC update in memory owned by the BDK.  There is a
region of Memory between 3/4 of the size of L2 and the size of L2 that may
be written to DRAM before DRAM is initialized.  Although this region is
unused and doesn't matter, this could cause the ECC bits for these cache
lines to not be updated.  This seems to happen most often on ODM boards
which have extra processing in the BDK before DRAM is initialized.  This
causes more L2 evicts.
** Change tabs to spaces in libdram.c.  Tabs shouldn't appear in the BDK.

== thunder-release-v1.23.4 ==
* Misc
** Update expected CPT fuses for CN81XX and CN80XX models
* Device Tree
** Fix UAA device entry.  The original device tree spec had a typo of
"uua" instead of "uaa" for the uart clock rate.  Fix the typo and update
comments.
** Fix issue where trace output could say a FDT was updated when it
wasn't.  For the sclk and refclkuaa clock-frequency updates, the code
would mistakenly trace that these were update if the node wasn't found.
With this fix, these will only report update if they were actually
changed.

== thunder-release-v1.23.3 ==
* Misc
** Add detection of Nitrox through checking fuse 231 (0xe7)
** Marvell RXAUI PHY needs reset and updated param
** Fix bug causing corruption of BGXX_CMRX_RX_DMAC_CTL.  The code for
enabling and disabling the BGX ports was incorrectly clearing mcst_mode in
BGXX_CMRX_RX_DMAC_CTL.  The purpose of the code was to hide unused BGX
ports on boards.  Due to this bug, pause frames for ports were being
dropped without being counter in stats.  The pause frames still worked,
just weren't counted.
** Fix spelling error in directory prompt and remember last selection
** Report failure if fatfs-tool can't copy a file
*** Copy now actually checks to see if the data was written to fat
*** Replace all output to stderr with stdout to fix print ordering issues
** Fix issue where "keys" in a menu says it was a invalid command
** Add the chip serial number to the device tree during init
* CCPI
** Use GTI timestamps to improve multi-node synchronization

== thunder-release-v1.23.2 ==
* PCIE
** Set SLIX_M2S_MACX_CTL[waitl_com] for more strict ordering.  Testing has
shown issues with the default weak ordering for PCIe.  Setting
SLIX_M2S_MACX_CTL[waitl_com] fixes the issue.  This is not as big of a
performance impact as WAIT_COM, so it is ok to have it on all the time.

== thunder-release-v1.23.1 ==
* CCPI
** Toggle the lane bad bit when we don't get a lane up.  In rare cases
we've seen lanes not become ready when everything else is good.  Toggling
the SER_LANE_BAD seems to restart the state machine and get the lane
ready.
** Once training RX ready is set, never clear it or ask for updates.
Following a theory that a bounce of RX_READY could cause one node to
complete training but the other one not, never clear RX_READY once it is
set.  When a lane transitions to RX_READY, force training to go idle and
wait for termination.

== thunder-release-v1.23 ==
* Operating system device tree changes
** Fix uart clock speed passed to next image. This fixes issues with Linux getting the incorrect baud rate.

** Allow configuration of usb reference clock(s) through device tree

* Misc
** CN88XX: Fix typo in SGMII menu option
** Improve SPI flash upload using xmodem
** Only check for debug magic key on master node. This fixes a crash of node 1 core 0 when the uart baud rate is changed on node 0.
** Improve GTI clock synchronization in dual node setups

== thunder-release-v1.22 ==
* Added support for CN88XX pass 2.1. Prior releases will crash when entering diagnostics on CN88XX pass 2.1 and higher.
* Added support for CN81XX.
* Added support for measuring SERDES quality using a vertical eye measurement
** New traffic-gen command "margin_rx" for networking related SERDES
** SATA menu option "Run margining tool"
** PCIe menu option "Run margining tool". This requires a CN73XX NIC plugged into the PCIe slot.
** New CCPI menu for testing and measurement
** Add support for GPIO toggle required for CN88XX with Nitrox
* Improved Power burn functionality
** Start / stop power burn manually
** Automated power burn transient load. On for 1 second, off for 1 second
** Power burn controlled separately for each node
** Power burn functionality moved into a new "Power Burn options" menu
* DDR

** BGX: Don't allow lane up to continue until RX equalization succeeds on all lanes
** Apply workaround for GSER-27882 to CCPI
** Improved default tuning for SERDES at 6.25G. RXAUI shows the most improvement
** Apply PEM config fixes required by errata for gen3 long channel (PEM-26189, PEM-21178)
** Update GSER-26150 workaround for CCPI
** Apply GSER-26150 to 8G and higher, not just 10G
** Implement workaround for GSER-27882 in BGX
** Change how KR training is tracked for BGX interfaces. Direction hints should always be correct now.
** The QLM tuning set function now allows setting PRE and POST independently
** Add a device tree config item for QLM insertion loss
** Change the default 10G swing and post emphasis for all CN8XXX chips
** Fix incorrect function call on eye parameters. Eye diagram should be avoided, only works on CN88XX pass 1.x

* Networking
** Various fixes for Cortina PHY update app
** Disable TNS support
** Rewrite NIC allocation to use one VF per interface, not port* USB: Add new config option to specify the polarity of the usb gpio

** Don't apply QLM tuning to PCIe Gen3 links
** Fixed memory transactions in the PCIe menu
** Add setup menu option to control PCIe ordering
** Disable ECRC for PCIe. It can be enabled by the operating system later if needed
* Misc
** Support building with GCC5. GCC5 executables will not work on CN88XX pass 1.x as GCC uses compare and swap
** Preliminary support for CN81XX and CN83XX
** Device tree files now contain some configuration items that are passed to ATF/UEFI but unused by the BDK
** Diagnostics now include SGPIO support (SATA LEDs)
** Chip SKU information is now displayed to the user and passed in the device tree
** Boot messages report secure or non-secure boot
** Dynamic device tree fixup for Linux. The BDK will now load an extra device tree for the operating system use. See documentation for details on BDK configuration.
** Add support for dynamic thermal monitoring. Add options to the setup menu to control power throttling. Diagnostics power menu options updated.
** Default hardware power throttle changed from 71% to 66%
** Improve the performance of the MPI/SPI transfers
** Use recursive lock for console output instead of spinlock. Fixes potential hangs with many output threads on one core.
** Add init of IOBX_NCB0_HP
** Many messages renames to remove references to THUNDERX
** USB XHCI support for hubs and mass storage. Storage devices with FatFS volumes can be read/written. Currently only the PAD reference clock is supported.
** File menu now has an option to list files in BDK file systems.
** Fixed issue where the device tree wasn't passed into diagnostics correctly if the machine had lots of DRAM
** Disabled SATA staggered spinup. Staggered spinup was found to cause issues with some SSDs
** PCIe scan and enumeration now understand ARI and Enhanced Allocation
** Change the SMI/MDIO drive strength to 30 ohm

== thunder-release-v1.21 ==
* Redo handling of CCPI link init to support CN88XX pass 2.0.
** The output format has changed greatly, using terminal escape sequences to present a per lane status.
** Add configuration item for CCPI lane reversal, set on CRB-2S EVT2. This item must be set on any board with lane reversal and CN88XX pass 1.x. Pass 2.0 should auto detect this, but that is untested.
** Node 0 and node 1 now share CCPI init code. The code is completely different than before, requiring much more testing.
** Software now intercepts all KR training status so it can control how long training runs for. This allows us to recover from pass 2.0's tendency for one side to finish training before the other side gets a chance.
** This code has been tested on:
*** CRB-2S-EVT4 with pass 2.0, 10G-KR CCPI
*** CRB-2S-EVT3 with pass 1.1, 6G CCPI
*** CRB-2S-EVT3 with pass 1.1, 10G-KR CCPI
*** CRB-2S-EVT2 with pass 1.0, 6G CCPI
*** EBB8800 with pass 1.0, 6G CCPI
*** EBB8800 with pass 1.0, 10G-KR CCPI
* Added DRAM margin tool
* Fix bug where ref clock not set after a soft reset on second QLM of PCIe x8
* Use THUNDER pass 2.x ability to override the internal VREF DAC setting.
* Implement automatic use of 100 MHz alternate refclk.
** Allow the DDR_ALT_REFCLK configuration option to force use of the alternate refclk speed specification for all DIMM types and DDR speeds.
** Add a Setup Menu item to show and change the DDR_ALT_REFCLK setting.
** When the DDR_ALT_REFCLK setting does not always force an alternate refclk, if the other DRAM configuration conditions do require use of alternate refclk, the code will still attempt initially to configure it and will use it if it is present, otherwise it will gracefully return to the standard 50MHz.
* Add workaround for Errata (AP-27388) Flavors of DMB not stalling on subsequent LD
* Errata (L2C-27380) L2C_OCI_CTL[LOCK_LOCAL_*,CAS_FDX] must be set
* Fix and re-activate the code to do setting of unused read-leveling and write-leveling CSRs.
* Read DIMM SPDs and store it in the device tree for later stages
** The SPD data is needed by later software to populate SMBIOS information, so read them before doing DRAM init. This also means the DRAM code no longer needs TWSI access while it runs.
* Disable GSER-27140 temperature workaround
** The workaround for GSER-27140 has been found to break CCPI at 10G on CN88XX pass 2.0. Disable GSER-27140 until this is resolved. The temperature ramp improvements are not interesting if we can't run CCPI at 10G.
* Clear all CCPI lane counters after CCPI init
** Lane errors hit during CCPI initialization are not interesting for debug. Clear all statistic counters after bringup the CCPI link. This will fix customers complaining about CCPI errors that were really one time issues during init.
* Add workaround for Bug #27499 - ISB not flushing the pipeline after a TLBI
* Apply tuning to CCPI using RX equalization only
* Start one core on each node as error reporting is enabled
** Error reporting runs as a thread on each node. If there are no cores running on remote nodes, then no errors will be reported. Always start one core on each node. This also requires that the remote cores be shutdown when we transition to another image.
** Error reporting runs as a thread on each node. If there are no cores running on remote nodes, then no errors will be reported. Always start one core on each node. This also requires that the remote cores be shutdown when we transition to another image.
* Preliminary support for compiling the BDK with LLVM
** The BDK currently boots, but doesn't work correctly. ARM64 support in LLVM 3.7.1 seems to have issues.
* The top level "license.txt" file summarizes all open source components and licenses in the BDK.
* Workarounds added for GSER temperature sensitivity (GSER-25992, GSER-26150, and GSER-27140)
** This may affect customers using CCPI in unexpected ways
* Cortina PHY firmware is updated on boot for the CRB-1S and CRB-2S
* Fix parsing error on TWSI device tree entries causing hex data to no be parsed
** This error caused the 40G port on the CRB-1S to not function

== thunder-release-v1.20 ==
* The BDK is now configured through a per board device tree. See TBD for documentation.
* The device tree changes require board manufacturing data to be stored at the end of flash. If this isn't present, boot will stop and the user will be prompted to enter the setup menu. This changes affects production flow as well as all existing boards.
* There are no longer and board specific C files. All board configuration happens in device tree. See TBD for how to add a board.
* Old DRAM configurations using C code can be converted to device tree by using the C code with the newer BDK. The BDK will display a message that it created a template device tree that the user can display.
* ATF and UEFI currently rely on hard-coded checks based on board name passed in X0 from the BDK. This will cause customer issues until ATF and UEFI transition to using the device tree in X1.
* The BDK stores MAC addresses in the board manufacturing data. UEFI has not been updated to use this data yet, so MAC addresses need to be entered twice.
* Output QLM tuning state when the user requests an RX equalization. This help the user manually tune QLMs.
* Reset the Cortina PHY on each connection side during init of the CRB-1S and CRB-2S.
* CRB-2S EVT3 no longer runs the DRAM test on boot. This is only needed on the EVT2.
* The watchdog timer is only enabled on the CRB-1S EVT2. EVT3 and EVT4 do not need the watchdog timer.
* The boot stub status codes reported to the BMC have changed.
* DRAM configuration can be performed by including common device trees for either DDR3 or DDR4. Customer boards are only expected to override the SPD addresses and DRAM speed grade.
* The diagnostics SATA menu now contains menu items for SATA pattern generation.
* Add ability to inject DRAM errors to verify ECC reporting
* DRAM fix: Apply workaround (24006) to Pass 2.0 as well as 1.x
* DRAM fix: Fix bug in pack_rlevel_settings() where byte 0 was not packed

Known Issues:
* CCPI link timeout if you perform a soft reset in the boot menu or exit the setup menu. Workaround is to power cycle the board after it hangs. Customers are not expected to hit this issue during normal operations, just initial configuration.
* This release requires a newer Cortina PHY image that supports both copper and optical on the CRB-1S and CRB-2S. Without this ROM update, networking doesn't work on the CRB-1S and CRB-2S. Link comes up but no packets flow.

These were in RC3 and removed in RC4 and beyond:
* New CCPI init sequence to better support CN88XX pass 2.0. This affects all passes of CN88XX.
* Configuration option CCPI-LANE-REVERSE must be set on boards using CN88XX pass 1.x with CCPI lanes revered. See CRB-2S EVT2 device tree for an example.

== thunder-release-THUNDERX_SDK_2.0.0_build_01 ==
* Apply workaround for (GSER-27140) 2015-10-23  SERDES temperature drift sensitivity in receiver
* Fix bug where KR auto-neg is restarted too quickly
* PCIe enumeration fix

== thunder-release-ThunderX-Firmware-Release-1.11.0 ==
* Disconnect GSER from SATA when running PRBS. The SATA path bypasses the pattern generators in GSER
* Remove the DRAM menu in bdk-boot/boot-stub.c
* Fix QLM tuning labels. Previous menus had many errors.
* Fix bug where dram init code was disabling the watchdog instead of poking it
* Add Enhanced Allocation support to the ECAM scan (CN88XX pass 2)
* Allow specially format config lines to cause arbitrary twsi writes
* Allow specially format config lines to cause arbitrary MDIO writes
* Add ability to run DRAM tests with CCPI nodes swizzled, testing CCPI
* Add config option to test DRAM on boot. Test each node independently so we can tell which one has trouble.
* Set L2C_OCI_CTL[lock_local_stc]=1 on CN88XX pass 2.x parts
* Apply GSER-26636 to CCPI QLMs
* Update PCIe enumeration to use same addresses Linux uses
* DRAM: allow tuning to be called via menu item
* Add MDIO writes to reset line side of PHYs on the CRB-1S
* Enable PCI enhanced allocation (EA) for the ATF and beyond
* Implement workaround for (ECAM-27114) PCIERC has incorrect device code
