          A power limiter for the chip.
          A limiter of the power consumption of the chip. This power
          limiting is implemented by a closed-loop feedback control
          system for the AVG_CHIP_POWER power approximation. The
          direct output of the PWR_SETTING feedback control system
          is the CURRENT_POWER_SETTING value. The power consumed
          by the chip (estimated currently by the AVG_CHIP_POWER
          value) is an indirect output of the PWR_SETTING feedback
          control system.
          PWR_SETTING is not used by the hardware when PWR_MIN equals
          PWR_MAX. PWR_MIN and PWR_MAX threshold requirements always
          supercede PWR_SETTING limits. (For maximum PWR_SETTING
          feedback control freedom, set PWR_MIN=0 and PWR_MAX=0xff.)
          PWR_SETTING equal to 0 forces the chip to consume near
          minimum power. Increasing PWR_SETTING value from 0 to
          0xffff increases the power that the chip is alloed to
          consume linearly (roughly) from minimum to maximum.

          Global throttling value currently being used.
          Throttling can force units (CPU cores, in particular) idle for a
          portion of time, which will reduce power consumption.  When
          CURRENT_POWER_SETTING is equal to zero, the unit is idle most
          of the time and consumes minimum power. When CURRENT_POWER_SETTING
          is equal to 0xFF, units are never idled to reduce power.
          The hardware generally uses a CURRENT_POWER_SETTING value that
          is as large as possible (in order to maximize performance) subject
          to the following constraints (in priority order):
            - PWR_MIN <= CURRENT_POWER_SETTING <= PWR_MAX
            - Power limits from the PWR_SETTING feedback control system
          In the case of the CPU cores, CURRENT_POWER_SETTING effectively
          limits the CP0 PowThrottle[POWLIM] value:
            effective POWLIM = MINIMUM(CURRENT_POWER_SETTING,PowThrottle[POWLIM])
