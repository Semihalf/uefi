  The PCIEEP()_CFG* registers (PCICONFIGEP) can be accessed from a remote device via PCIe Port 0
  or Port 1, or they can be accessed via the PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers. Note that
  each port can directly access only its local EP PCIe configuration registers via standard PCIe
  configuration read/write operations. When accessing the PCIEEP()_CFG* registers via the
  PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD registers, the ADDR field must match the PCIe configuration
  space address. PCIEEP Registers lists the PCICONFIGEP registers.

  The PCIEEP()_CFG()_MASK registers are write-only registers (EP mode only) and are only
  accessible via the PEM()_CFG_WR registers. The ADDR field of the PEM()_CFG_WR registers
  must match the address listed in PCIEEP Registers.

  Note that the RO/WRSL field access type applies to PCICONFIGEP registers only. The RO/WRSL fields
  are RO if accessed from the physical PCIe port, and R/W if accessed via
  PEM()_CFG_WR/PEM()_CFG_RD.

          * To send a specific PCI Express message, the application writes the payload of the
          message into this register, then sets bit 0 of the port link control register to send the
          message.

          * To store a corruption pattern for corrupting the LCRC on all TLPs, the application
          places a 32-bit corruption pattern into this register and enables this function by setting
          bit 25 of the port link control register. When enabled, the transmit LCRC result is XORed
          with this pattern before inserting it into the packet.

          This field indicates the maximum number of lanes supported by the PCIe port. The value can
          be set less than 0xF to limit the number of lanes that the PCIe will attempt to use. If
          the value of 0xF set by the hardware is not desired, this field can be programmed to a
          smaller value (i.e. EEPROM). See also PCIEEP()_CFG031[MLW].
          The value of this field does not indicate the number of lanes in use by the PCIe. This
          field sets the maximum number of lanes in the PCIe core that could be used. As per the
          PCIe specification, the PCIe core can negotiate a smaller link width, so all of x8, x4,
          x2, and x1 are supported when
          LME = 0xF, for example.
