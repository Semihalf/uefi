      The MSI-X Table is 65 entries deep. Each MAC can see up to 64 VF ring entries and its own
      PF entry.

      The first 64 entries contain MSI-X vectors for each of the 64 DPI Packet rings. Entries, or
      rings, are assigned to PEM0 and/or PEM2 based on the SRN, RPVF, and TNR registers.  Each VF
      has access to only its own entries and therefore will see the MSI-X Table as smaller than 64
      entries, unless all 64 rings are assigned to it. A VF must not try to configure more entries
      than it owns. A VF will always see its first entry as entry 0. The actual MSI-X Table Offset
      is calculated as follows;   (SRN + ((VF#-1) * RPVF)).

      The last (i.e. 65th) entry is for PCIe related errors and is only accessible by the
      PF. There are actually two entries at the 65th location; one for each MAC's PF. The hardware
