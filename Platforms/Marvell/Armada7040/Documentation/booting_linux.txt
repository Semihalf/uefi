Booting Linux from UEFI
-----------------------
In order to boot Linux from UEFI EFI_STUB is used. EFI_STUB is part of
Linux kernel that acts like UEFI application. It was appended to UEFI
image as a part of FV filesystem.

Usage
-----
Once UEFI is built from delivered branch, required Linux image and
DTB file are attached. To run, boot UEFI and execute:
  fs1:
  Linux.efi dtb=armada.dtb console=ttyS0,115200

Please note that in order to boot Linux psci must be disabled. It can be
achieved by removing / disabling psci DTS node.
